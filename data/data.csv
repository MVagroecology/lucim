All;Livestock;Mixed farming: Between-farms synergy;"Strong temporal and spatial integration between crops, grasslands, and animals among farms. Involves resource sharing, mainly land sharing: farmers group their respective land areas and collectively plan land use of each field and animal movements. Based on practices such as stubble grazing; sacrificial grazing of grain crops; introducing intercropped forage crops, temporary grasslands, and forage legumes in crop rotations; grazing animals from livestock farms on crop farms and arrangements such as potato–dairy systems. Coordination between farmers must be strong and long-lasting to manage rotational manure application and occurrence of grasslands in crop rotations.";;;Higher;Higher;Higher;Higher;Higher;Higher;Higher;No consensus;No consensus;No consensus;No consensus;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;x;x;;x;x;;x;;;;;x;;;;x;x;;x;x;;;;;;x;;;;;;x;;
All;Livestock;Mixed farming: Within-farm complementarity ;Involves temporal coordination of one-way flow or exchanges of raw materials between spatially segregated farm components. Involves strategic planning among crop and livestock components to match supply and demand for feedstuff through adapted crop rotations including grasslands, forage crops, and cover crops that produce forage, and optimize manure allocation based on needs of field soils of the farm.;;;Higher;No consensus;No consensus;Higher;No consensus;Higher;Same;No consensus;No consensus;No consensus;No consensus;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;;x;x;;x;;x;x;;;;;;;;;x;x;;x;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
