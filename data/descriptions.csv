Climate region;Climate impact driver;Projection;Description
Northern Europe;Cold extremes;Decrease;Cold extremes in Northern Europe are expected to <span class="impact-projection">decrease</span>. This may lead to <span class="impact-consequences">increases in pests and diseases</span>.
Northern Europe;Drought;Increase;At higher levels of global warming, projections are for an <span class="impact-projection">increase</span> in droughts in Northern Europe. This <span class="impact-consequences">increases water stress, heat stress, wildfire incidences and soil erosion, and reduces pollination services and agricultural and forestry productivity</span>.
Northern Europe;Extreme precipitation;Increase;Heavy precipitation events in Northern Europe are expected to <span class="impact-projection">increase</span>. This may lead to <span class="impact-consequences">increases in flooding and soil erosion and a decrease in forestry and agricultural productivity</span>.
Northern Europe;Heat extremes;Increase;Heat extremes are projected to <span class="impact-projection">increase</span> in Northern Europe. Associated impacts and risks include <span class="impact-consequences">increased heat and water stress, an increase in wildfires and soil erosion, reduced pollination services and labour productivity, and a decrease in agricultural and forestry productivity</span>.
Northern Europe;Mean precipitation;Increase;Mean precipitation during winter months in Northern Europe is expected to <span class="impact-projection">increase</span>. This may <span class="impact-consequences">increase soil erosion, flooding incidences and forestry and agricultural productivity</span>.
Northern Europe;Mean temperature;Increase;Mean temperatures in Northern Europe are projected to <span class="impact-projection">increase</span>. This warming may lead to some short-term benefits such as <span class="impact-consequences">earlier onset of the growing season and increased crop yields and forest growth</span>. However, the longer growing season will support the <span class="impact-consequences">expansion of invasive species and may increase pests and diseases</span>.
Northern Europe;Windstorms;Increase;Severe windstorms in Northern Europe are projected to <span class="impact-projection">increase</span>. Associated impacts include <span class="impact-consequences">increased soil erosion and potential impacts on crop and forestry production</span>.
Southern Europe;Cold extremes;Decrease;Cold extremes in Southern Europe are projected to <span class="impact-projection">decrease</span>. This may lead to <span class="impact-consequences">increases in pests and diseases</span>.
Southern Europe;Drought;Increase;Projections are for an <span class="impact-projection">increase</span> in droughts in Southern Europe. This <span class="impact-consequences">increases water stress, heat stress, wildfire incidences and soil erosion, and reduces pollination services and agricultural and forestry productivity</span>.
Southern Europe;Extreme precipitation;Increase;Heavy precipitation events in Southern Europe are expected to <span class="impact-projection">increase</span>. This may lead to <span class="impact-consequences">increases in flooding and soil erosion and a decrease in forestry and agricultural productivity</span>.
Southern Europe;Heat extremes;Increase;Heat extremes in Southern Europe are projected to <span class="impact-projection">increase</span>. Associated impacts and risks include <span class="impact-consequences">increased heat and water stress, an increase in wildfires and soil erosion, reduced pollination services and labour productivity, and a decrease in agricultural and forestry productivity</span>.
Southern Europe;Mean precipitation;Decrease;Mean precipitation in Southern Europe is projected to <span class="impact-projection">decrease</span>, particularly in the summer months. The ability to adapt using <span class="impact-consequences">irrigation will be increasingly limited by water availability and the risk of water scarcity will increase, leading to decreases in agricultural and forest productivity</span>. Water stress will also <span class="impact-consequences">increase the incidences and effects of wildfires</span>.
Southern Europe;Mean temperature;Increase;Mean temperatures in Southern Europe are projected to <span class="impact-projection">increase</span>. Largely negative impacts are projected including <span class="impact-consequences">increased water demand, reduced growing season length, losses in agricultural and forestry production, increases in pests and diseases and water scarcity</span>.
Southern Europe;Windstorms;Increase;Severe windstorms in Southern Europe are projected to <span class="impact-projection">increase</span>. Associated impacts include <span class="impact-consequences">increased soil erosion and potential impacts on crop and forestry production</span>.
Western and Central Europe;Cold extremes;Decrease;Cold extremes are projected to <span class="impact-projection">decrease</span> in Western and Central Europe. This may lead to <span class="impact-consequences">increases in pests and diseases</span>.
Western and Central Europe;Drought;Increase;At higher levels of global warming, projections are for an <span class="impact-projection">increase</span> in droughts in Western and Central Europe. This <span class="impact-consequences">increases water stress, heat stress, wildfire incidences and soil erosion, and reduces pollination services and agricultural and forestry productivity</span>.
Western and Central Europe;Extreme precipitation;Increase;Heavy precipitation events are projected to <span class="impact-projection">increase</span> in Western and Central Europe. This may lead to <span class="impact-consequences">increases in flooding and soil erosion and a decrease in forestry and agricultural productivity</span>.

Western and Central Europe;Mean precipitation;Increase;<span class="impact-projection">Increases</span> in mean precipitation have been observed in Western and Central Europe. However, there is <span class="impact-projection">low confidence in projections of the direction of change</span> under global warming scenarios. Increases in mean precipitation may <span class="impact-consequences">increase soil erosion, flooding incidences and forestry and agricultural productivity</span>.
Western and Central Europe;Mean temperature;Increase;Mean temperatures in Western and Central Europe are projected to <span class="impact-projection">increase</span>.
