Exposure;exposure_8;Trees act as barriers to reduce exposure to pests and diseases.;Reduces the risk of crop and livestock pests or diseases and impacts crop and livestock health, survival, growth and productivity.
Exposure;exposure_9;Active management by agroforestry reduces exposure to wildfires.;Reduces the risk of wildfires in forests due to reduced fuel load (by grazing livestock) and lower tree densities. This impacts tree survival, growth and productivity, and human health.
Sensitivity;sensitivity_1;Tree roots reduce sensitivity to precipitation changes and extremes by increasing water infiltration and enhancing soil structure.;Reduces flooding and waterlogging, water run-off, soil erosion and nutrient loss through leaching. This impacts crop and pasture health, survival, growth and productivity.
Sensitivity;sensitivity_2;Trees reduce sensitivity to precipitation changes and extremes by increasing soil organic matter.;Leaf fall and root turnover increase soil organic matter which increases water holding capacity and soil biodiversity. This impacts crop and pasture health, survival, growth and productivity.
Sensitivity;sensitivity_3;Livestock reduce sensitivity to climate impacts on trees by increasing nutrient cycling.;Integrating livestock into tree systems increases nutrient cycling through grazing and manure deposition. This impacts tree health, growth and productivity.
Sensitivity;sensitivity_4;Trees reduce sensitivity to climate impacts on forage availability by providing alternative fodder resources.;Impacts livestock health, survival, growth and productivity, by enabling forage in periods of scarcity
Sensitivity;sensitivity_5;Trees reduce sensitivity to climate impacts on livestock by improving livestock health & welfare.;Tree fodder provides nutritional and medicinal resources, and trees provide structures for improved body care and better social interactions. This increases livestock health and welfare and impacts survival, growth and productivity.
Sensitivity;sensitivity_6;Increased habitat diversity reduces sensitivity to climate impacts by increasing functional biodiversity.;System complexity increases habitat diversity and ecological niches which increases diversity of functional groups including pollinators and natural enemies. This provides functional redundancy therefore stabilises the provision of regulating ecosystem services including pest control and pollination, leading to impacts on crop and pasture health, survival, growth and productivity
Sensitivity;sensitivity_7;Increased system diversity reduces sensitivity to climate impacts by increasing agrobiodiversity.;Diversity of system components (trees, crops, livestock) increases stability in production, due to complementarity in resource use and compensation in varying climate conditions..
Sensitivity;sensitivity_8;Livestock grazing reduces sensitivity to climate impacts by reducing pests and diseases.;Livestock control weeds and pests (through browsing on diseased leaves and fruits) therefore increasing tree health, growth and productivity.
Sensitivity;sensitivity_9;System complexity reduces sensitivity to climate impacts by increasing resource use efficiency.;Complementarity in resource use (water, nutrients, space, radiation) leads to efficient systems that can buffer impacts of climate change.
Sensitivity;sensitivity_10;Increased system diversity reduces sensitivity to climate impacts by increasing income diversity.;Diversity of system components (trees, crops, livestock) increases stability in income, due to complementarity in resource use and compensation in varying climate conditions.
Sensitivity;sensitivity_11;Livestock manure and grassland reduce sensitivity to precipitation changes and extremes by increasing soil organic matter.;Addition of manure and/or estabshment of grassland increase soil organic matter which increases water holding capacity and soil biodiversity. This impacts crop and pasture health, survival, growth and productivity.
Sensitivity;sensitivity_12;Cycling of materials reduces reliance on external inputs which reduces sensitivity to impacts of climate change on external supply chains.;Exchange of feed and manure at a local level reduces the need for external inputs such as fertilisers and feed, and less reliant on transport services, therefore making the farm less sensitive to price changes or availability shortages caused by climate change impacts  on the supply chain.
Sensitivity;sensitivity_13;Regional agricultural diversity and collaboration between farms reduces sensitivity to climate impacts at a landscape scale.  ;At a landscape scale, a diversity of farming systems working together  increases stability in production, due to complementarity in resource use and compensation in varying climate conditions.
Adaptive Capacity;adaptive_capacity_1;System diversity increases adaptive capacity by increasing agrobiodiversity.;Diversity of system components (trees, crops, livestock) increases ability of the system to moderate potential damage by spreading risk of climate change impacts on yields and taking advantage of variable conditions whereby productivity of one component can compensate for others impacted by climate.
Adaptive Capacity;adaptive_capacity_2;System diversity increases adaptive capacity through income diversification;Diversifying income sources reduces dependency on single crops and allows the system to adapt to changing conditions.
Adaptive Capacity;adaptive_capacity_3;System diversity increases adaptive capacity by increasing livelihood opportunities.;Diversity of system components (trees, crops, livestock) increases livelihood opportunities, strengthening local communities therefore increasing the ability to adjust to climate change by being able to take advantage of opportunities.
Adaptive Capacity;adaptive_capacity_4;System diversity increases adaptive capacity by increasing local economic opportunities.;Diversifying income sources contributes to and strengthens local economies which in turn provides a supportive environment that can help farms adapt to changing conditions.
Adaptive Capacity;adaptive_capacity_5;Strong community engagement and collaboration increases adaptive capacity by increasing the ability to cope with consequences of climate change.;Agroecological approaches encourage community engagement and collaboration in their design, establishment and management. In turn, this provides a supportive environment that can help farms adapt to changing conditions.
Adaptive Capacity;adaptive_capacity_6;Traditional agroforestry systems increase adaptive capacity by building on a strong knowledge base and indigenous experience;Traditional and indigenous knowledge, as well as local practices and experiences, play a valuable role in informing the design, implementation, and management of agroforestry systems, therefore contributing to their success and resilience in diverse contexts.
Adaptive Capacity;adaptive_capacity_8;Strong collaboration and coordination with other farmers increases adaptive capacity by increasing the ability to cope with consequences of climate change.;Synergies between farms with regards resource use requires reliable collaboration between farmers. This builds strong relationships that provide a supportive environment that can help farms adapt to changing conditions.
