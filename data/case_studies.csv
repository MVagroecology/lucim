Cork is an important source of income every 10 years, with an average productivity of 41.000 kg per harvest. Pruning holm oak trees results in about 25.000 kg of fuelwood annually as well as providing animals with palatable tree fodder in winter when grass resources are limited.";In addition to the extensive areas of wooded pastures, 75 ha is pasture land, which are reserved for hay production.;Livestock and forest resources are rich and varied. The wooded pastures of Casablanca permanently sustain 135 cattle heads of the native breed Avileña and Berrenda and 14 heads of certified Iberian pigs. An additional 125 Iberian pigs pasture (pannage) in these woodlands during the mast season, from October to January. The practices of rotational grazing, based on a careful assessment of pasture carrying capacity and a strict control of the number of days livestock can graze each plot, and transterminance- the seasonal movement of part of the herd to the summer grazing lands- are key to the long-term persistence of the Dehesa of Casablanca, as pasture productivity is enhanced while tree regeneration is ensured as a result of reduced animal browsing. Every year from October to June Dehesa of Casablanca also host 150 beehives for honey production. The beekeeper pays the farm owners a token amount of honey for self-consumption.;Dehesa of Casablanca is a family owned and managed livestock farm located in Oliva de Plasencia, southwestern Spain. It is a productive, profitable and environmentally friendly organic farm that can be considered the epitome of sustainable land management. The concepts of diversity, in habitats, vegetation types, resources, and livelihoods, and adaptability underpins management approaches and decisions. The farm has a total area of 421 ha of wooded pastures, pasture land, cork oak forest and organic olive orchards. Water resources are abundant throughout the farm. There are 2 man-made lakes, 6 ponds and 1 natural spring and a seasonal brook that runs through the farm. These water bodies are important not only for livestock but also as the habitat for a variety of aquatic birds and amphibians, and as the source of drinking water for many wild animals including deer and wild boar.;dehesa_casablanca_olivadeplasencia.jpg;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10902817;EURAF Featured Farm;;;;;;
12;Darliner farm;EURAF Featured Farms;Southern Europe;Italy;42.680288955498945, 12.331809351709744;Intercropped orchards;7;"About 0.7 ha are managed as intercropped fruit orchards. The fruit orchards include several traditional varieties of fruit species, such as mulberry, apricot, apple, almond, quince tree, etc. Fruits are usually processed to produce delicious homemade jams. About 4 ha of the farm land are managed with olive orchards. Olive trees comprise local and traditional varieties and are managed according to two planting schemes: in the first one about 600 trees (approximately 40 years old) are planted at a spacing of 6x6 m; in the second about 300 older olive trees are planted at wider distance (about 12x12 m) allowing the intercropping with arable crops. In terms of economic revenue, the extra-virgin olive oil is the most important product of the farm. Olive orchards usually produce about 9 tons of olives per year. Olives are usually collected at the beginning of November and processed in a local olive mill. The annual extra-virgin olive oil production is about 1,200 litres. The olive oil is mainly destined to domestic market; a limited percentage is sold abroad. Pruning olive trees and harvesting olives are the most costly management practices, in terms of labour. Soil fertility is integrated using only manure, without any chemical fertilizers or treatments, and all the farm products are really organic. Moreover, phytosanitary control of pathogens, in particular olive fly, is carried out adoption biological methods. Olive orchards are kept with natural grass between the tree rows and weed is periodically mown. In terms of expenses, the olive process at the oil mill accounts about 43% of the total cost. Farm comprises also small wooded areas managed to collect wood that is used to satisfy the energy need of the farm.";Intercropped with the fruit trees are aspagarus and artichokes. Farm includes also 0.2 ha of arable field where cereals are produced mainly to feed poultry, and legumes are grown for home consumption. In addition, in a small portion of the farm land, the feasibility of producing new products such as raspberries and other secondary products is being tested and experimented with the aim to integrate farm income. In addition, a water source and a small artificial water basin are included in the farm. The water is used to irrigate the homegarden where various seasonal vegetables are cultivated in rotation, allowing the production of different vegetables during the whole year.;;“Darliner” is a small-scale farm located in the southern-west part of Umbria Region, Central Italy. Around the farm, a mosaic of agroforestry systems, at different level of complexity, characterizes the rural landscape. Olive groves, often managed in combination with pasture or intercropped with cereals, and vineyards are the most common agricultural crops on hilly lands. Other crops, such as sunflower and tobacco are cultivated in small portion of plain lands. Agricultural fields are usually alternated with wooded lands with oaks, ash, maple, etc. managed as coppice to produce fuelwood destined to local energy market. The farm size is about 7 ha, including the house where the family lives. The overall objective of the farmers is to produce enough food and energy to self-sustain the family in an environmental friendly way. Since they started agricultural activity without any specific background and experience, they began to get basic technical skills and knowledge by consulting their neighbour farmers.;darliner_farm.jpg;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10907282;EURAF Featured Farm;;;;;;

Tree species encompass both fruit trees and common forest deciduous trees. These are planted in belts and in copses on hilltops. We can find here alley cropping systems as single row belts, planted on grasslands as well as between fields. Tree species, properly selected for the habitat, include lime, birch, oak, beech, European hornbeam and horse chestnut. Multifunctional belts in the form of hedgerows acting as buffers against erosion and wind are usually planted between fields. They also protect natural habitats and apiaries sites, which are particularly susceptible to environmental influences. To create hedgerows both trees and bushes are planted. The bushes have edible fruits or nuts and are adapted to the conditions within the hedge. In recent years, 5 kilometres of hedges (78,000 square meter) and about 5,000 solitary trees have been planted on the farmland. Moreover, natural stands of mid-field trees are maintained, particularly the ones around marshy areas and water reservoirs.;It consists of 1,450 ha of arable land, 340 ha of grasslands and 7.5 ha of vegetables gardens.;Almost 700 head of cattle are kept here.;“Juchowo Farm” is a large-scale farm in North-Western Poland near Szczecinek, established in 2000, operating on nearly 2,000 hectares of land. It is one of the best examples of a multifunctional farm in Poland and is a forerunner in the introduction of modern agroforestry practices in this part of Europe. “Juchowo Farm” is a biodynamic farm with a strongly diversified agricultural production. The main source of income for the farm is the production and sale of biodynamic milk. Additionally, 77 other biodynamic products are sold directly at the farm, including different types of bread, cheese, herbs, fruit syrups and vegetables. The farm employs approximately 90 workers including 6 mentally disabled people. Another 30 people work regularly at a therapeutic base at “Juchowo Farm”.

With this system, the forest owners get understory bushes removed. So, the whole system is optimized. The system reduces the carbon footprint of both farms, as mechanical clearing is not needed, forest fires are reduced and the forest owner has a great reduction of the costs.;The farm transformed 10 ha of land full of bushes to grassland with a long term mixture of seeds.;In order to control and take advantage of the existing bushes, they introduced a 150 goat flock. In 2015, a flock of 100 ewes joined the goats to diversify the farm's production and increase the pasture use efficiency. Goats transform forest woody understory into herbaceous vegetation, which is better used by sheep.;"""La Cabreta"" is an outdoor goat and sheep production enterprise linked to forest and grasslands. It was established in 2008 in Meira (Lugo province of Galicia region) on rented lands from the Banco de Terras de Galicia. The starting point for “La Cabreta” was 26 ha of abandoned land full of bushes (Ulex europaeus and Ulex gallii). The farmers implemented extensive management (all day, all night and 365 days/year outdoor grazing time) in a high wolf density area thanks to the cooperation with their neighbors. Marketing has proven to be really important, because extensive grazing systems are based on low inputs. Therefore, they decided to join other sheep and goat farmers and start a quality label called ""Cordeiro e Cabrito Atlántico"" (Atlantic Lamb and Kit, https://www.facebook.com/cordeirocabritoatlantico) based on this extensive flock management system. Through the company they started, called Beealia (https://www.facebook.com/beealia/), they sell their products to restaurants, butcheries and the general public all over Spain.";la_cabreta.jpg;https://www.facebook.com/beealia/;Beelia;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10907430;EURAF Featured Farm;https://www.facebook.com/cordeirocabritoatlantico;"Quality label ""Cordeiro e Cabrito Atlántico"" (Atlantic Lamb and Kit)";;

These agroforestry plots with valuable timber trees are not an alternative to traditional orchards, but a possible additional form of landuse.  Due to the use of fast-growing fruit varieties the plots resemble the traditional orchards and ﬁt into the local landscape. Using fruit trees to produce valuable timber generates an additional value and brings back the concept of use to areas with fruit trees. The tree’s ecological value is also very important for the city: it's assumed that not all trees will show perfect growth, although those will not be replaced, remaining instead as habitat trees. ";The trees were planted on extensive grassland.;The land is mown, mulched and/or grazed by sheep.;"Donzdorf is a city of 11.000 inhabitants in the Stuttgart area of Germany at the fringe of the Schwäbische Alb mountains. The region is located in the transitional zone between urban and rural area and characterized by its traditional fruit orchards. Between 2007 and 2010 the city established ﬁve agroforestry plots with trees for valuable timber production on city-owned land, sized 0,15 to 0,75 ha. Two of the plots have been approved as an eco-account (compensation balance) measure by the responsible local nature conservation authority. For the measure the city volunteered to make the following commitments: (i) long-term preservation of remaining traditional orchard trees; (ii) permanent extensiﬁcation of understory (grassland); (iii) trees can be cut at the earliest after 60 years, cut trees need to be replaced; (iv) no clear cuts; (v) diﬀerent tree species have varied growth rates, therefore a continuous regeneration of the tree stock is guaranteed; (vi) 10 % of trees remain untouched as habitat trees; (vii) installation of 5 nesting aids. Although working intensive in the establishment phase the management of the valuable timber plots can be mastered more easily by the city in the long-term compared to traditional orchards, e.g. longer trunks facilitate the management of the grassland and pruning is less labour intensive. This is one of the reasons why this new approach found broad approval and support within the local community and administration.";donzdorf.png;https://www.agroforst.multifunktion.uni-freiburg.de/Downloads/krause.pdf;Georg Krause: Agroforstsysteme im Kommunalbereich - ein Erfahrungsbereicht aus der Stadt Donzdorf;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10927040;EURAF Featured Farm;;;;

The farmer experiments with two chicken breeds. Bress chickens (Les Bleus) are raised as a dual-purpose breed. Characteristic features are the snow-white plumage, the blue legs and the red comb, symbolizing le drapeau tricolore. The laying hens are New Hampshire, a robust breed with good laying performance, which is widespread in organic farming. The chickens can use the agroforestry system on grassland on the one hand and the orchard meadows on the other. The cow feels very comfortable as a forest and steppe animal in agroforestry systems. The strips of wood offer shade and protect against bad weather. The cows like to linger in the shade of the trees to ruminate. Healing effects such as the salicylic acid of willow leaves are instinctively used by the cow ""when she has a headache"". In addition, agroforestry systems improve the microclimate. The farmer was able to observe, for example, that in the wake of global warming and ozone pollution, cows are increasingly less likely to go outside during the day. The milk is processed in the farm's own cheese dairy and the daughter Johanna runs an excellent restaurant in the restored former cowshed.";The Biolandhof Braun is a much-diversified organic farm with 58 ha of arable land, 17 ha of permanent grassland and some forest.

An extensive forest garden or “food forest” is a collection of more unusual edible species including sorbs, raisin trees, jujubes, wild persimmons, honey locust, elderberries, aronia berries. In the summer, forest trees are thinned, providing forage as well as wood for winter heating.;Wild asparagus are grown both under olive trees and under the wine grapes. Artichokes are also cultivated under the vineyard, growing in fall winter and spring when the grapes are dormant. A large no-till vegetable and herb garden completes the farm: manure from the dairy animals is used to prepare the transplanting beds, in a thick enough layer to kill present weeds and prevent further weeds from germinating. Transplants are then planted in the soil by opening small holes in the manure layer and filling it with compost.;The orchards are grazed by geese and Comisana dairy sheep, while Alpine goats and Jersey cows are kept out to prevent damage to the fruit trees. All animals rotate through pastures and the forest, grazing on native grasses, forest trees and acorns. Hens weed and fertilize the vineyard, aided by the sheep in fall, winter and spring, before the grapevines sprout.;Località il Piano is a 30 hectare family-run organic and agroforestry farm in central Italy, operating since 2001. The first thing Darcy Gordon and Adolfo Rosati did was to plant fruit trees, as many as possible and of as many varieties as possible! Currently, about 1500 different varieties of fruit are cultivated on the farm. Farm products including fruit and vegetables, eggs, meat, dairy products (blue cheese, camembert, chevre, feta, yogurt, etc.) are sold weekly in town to consumers through a WhatsApp group, and to the guests staying in the two agriturismo apartments, with the rest donated to local charities. Since hand labor is the limiting factor on this farm, systems are designed to require the bare minimum amount of human work from outside the family (though a lot of work within the family!). As much as possible, crops, varieties and systems needing little labor are preferred. Animals, managed with both permanent and mobile fencing, do most of the weeding and fertilizing. Extra seasonal help comes from interns and WWOOFers (i.e. volunteers adhering to the WWOOF program: World-Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms). The farm also offers educational group activities like classes on identifying and cooking wild edible species, tastings of farm products, cheese making from barn to fork, cider-making and other agricultural activities. Often an informal meal with farm products is provided, sometimes pizza cooked in the woodfired oven and made with vegetables and cheeses, picked and produced together with the guests just few minutes earlier. ;localitailpiano.jpg;https://localitailpiano.it/;Località il Piano;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10907476;EURAF Featured Farm;;;;

They have set aside a further 9ha for natural regeneration and are starting to look at incorporating more trees in the fields including fruit and nut varieties. Trees can help to keep the animals safe in all weathers as well as offering them a different but essential type of forage. They also help to keep them safe by sheltering buildings and provide all of the wood fuel to keep them warm in the winter.;;The animals comprise of Highland Cattle, Jacob Sheep, Oxford Sandy and Black pigs, a variety of hens and multiple colonies of Scottish Black Bees. They apply no inputs and instead use nature as their guide to always improve diversity and regenerate the land. High animal welfare is paramount to the success of the business and they work hard to ensure that the animals are able to express their natural behaviours and source everything they need from the land to keep them mentally and physically healthy.;Lynbreck Croft is a 150 acre mixed habitat holding in the Cairngorms National Park, Scotland. There is a mixture of heather clad hill, bog, established woodland and unimproved pasture. The prevailing weather comes from the south, but is already already noticeable that weather extremes are becoming the rule rather than the exception. Drought, prolonged snow, high winds and short but heavy rain downpours are becoming more frequent. The goal at Lynbreck is to build a profitable, small farm business where every decision outcome must have a positive environmental impact. They aim to be carbon neutral and use a team of native animals, suitable for the land and climate, to help them build soil and organic matter.;lynbreck_croft.jpg;https://www.lynbreckcroft.co.uk/;Lynbreck Croft;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10907581;EURAF Featured Farm;;;;

Attention is paid to leave tree re-growth in place and to provide natural protection by retaining some thorny bushes. Ancient, crumbling, trees are left in the area consciously. The main aim of their farming is to preserve the genetic stock of native breeds and to produce breeders. They follow the retaining selection principle for which the appropriate environment is provided by the wooded pasture. Livestock is kept outdoors all year round.

Well-maintained ‘Knicks’ offer a remarkable ecological diversity, because they are structured into tree, shrub and grass layer - as two assembled forest margins. Among the prevailing plants are whitethorn, blackthorn, oak trees and wild fruits.;;Angus cows;"In 2017, Rindergilde Geesthacht won an award for their well-maintained ‘Knicks’. The so-called ‘Knicks’ are a wide-spread traditional hedgerow system in the region of Schleswig-Holstein, with a combined length of more than 68.000 kilometres – corresponding to one and a half times the circumference of the earth. ‘Knicks’ are man-made soil ridges covered with trees, shrubs and herbs. They were established from the mid-18th century to mark plot boundaries, to ensure that grazing livestock did not stray onto neighbouring land, and to provide products as fuel or construction material. The ‘Rindergilde Geesthacht’ started cattle grazing in 1988 with 14 members and on 3 ha of land. In the meanwhile the association consists of 200 members, owns 20 Angus cows and the farmed area amounts to 52 ha, of these, 40 ha are permanent pastures. The farm allows the livestock to graze all year round and is certified organic since 20 years. In the 1960s and 1970s, most ‘Knicks’ disappeared from the farm; only 800 m were left along both sides of a farm track in 1988. In the meanwhile their combined length increased to more than 4 km: 3.5 km of ‘Knicks’ have been newly established over the past three decades. The planting activities were financially supported by the rural district. The cattle is using the ‘Knicks’ as an additional source of fodder. Hedgerow pruning provides woodchips for regional thermal utilization; thicker wood is removed and used by the association’s members.";rindergilde.jpg;https://www.rindergilde-geesthacht.de/rindergilde-geesthacht-gewinnt-1-preis-in-der-kategorie-knick-am-gruenland-des-schleswig-holsteinischer-heimatbund-shhb/;Rindergilde Geesthacht 'knicks';https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10908992;EURAF Featured Farm;https://collaboratif.cirad.fr/alfresco/s/d/workspace/SpacesStore/6bb2c32b-6f75-409d-86f2-aedf8f6b26d1?attach=true;‘Knicks’ - traditional hedgerow system;;

The farm started this activity only few years ago with a handful of chickens. The owner wanted to rear his animals outdoors, letting them graze the land. He quickly realized that the chickens could provide benefits to the olive orchard in terms of weeding and fertilizing and, vice versa, the olive trees were beneficial for the poultry in terms of shade and protection from some predators. So he built animal shelters, spread over several olive fields (to keep the birds in small units and to optimize grazing uniformity), often adjacent to forest areas to provide increased shelter and feeding opportunities for the birds.;SanBart.png;https://pollosanbartolomeo.it/en/azienda-agricola-san-bartolomeo-organic-products/;San Bartolomeo;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10909003;EURAF Featured Farm;;;;

An orchard has been established with upper stem fruit trees. Mainly apple (Malus) trees were used. A chestnut plantation is Eichhofs third silvopastoral system.;Forage and grain production. The farm creates value through a diverse crop rotation on their fields. Constantly changing plant species creates a remarkably diverse biodiversity around the farm. In order to take action against the threat of widespread insect death, they have been creating a one- or two-year-old flower strip between pastures every spring since 2018.;Herd of 70 cows of Holstein Friesian for milk production.;The Riecken family farms the Eichhof since 1899. Today it is run by the 4th generation moving towards the 5th. The farm is specialised in ecological milk production with a herd of 70 cows of Holstein Friesian, which is a typical milk breed worldwide. The grazing is structured by 16 parcels based on an Irish continuous grazing system. The Riecken family is farming on 70 hectares plus 20 hectares lease. During 2018, which was an extraordinary dry year, family Riecken noticed clearly the signs of heat stress among their cows. In addition, fodder reserves for the winter had to be released in August. This traumatic year strengthened the decision to implement agroforestry. The main reasons are carbon drawdown, creating a temperate microclimate and opening up new food sources. Together with professional consulting, support of two foundations and around 100 volunteers, family Riecken planted approximately 1.400 trees in autumn 2020. Besides the cowfarm the Eichhof consists of a small dairy processing unit and a farm shop. Furthermore, many events take place in the farm, for instance education programs for kids and adults. The direct selling of diverse milk products enables the Riecken family to work together with almost 30 employees. Furthermore, it guarantees a financial stability. This financial foundation paves the way for experimenting with new farming methods, such as silvopastoral farming.;rieckens_landmilch.jpg;https://rieckens-landmilch.de/landwirtschaft/;Rieckens Landmilch;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10909014;EURAF Featured Farm;https://agroforst-info.de/im-portraet-felix-riecken/;"DeFAF ""In the portrait: Felix Riecken""";;

A three-breed rotational crossing of dairy breeds (Holstein, Scandinavian Red, and Jersey).;OasYs is an innovative mixed crop-dairy system redesigned though a collaborative approach in 2013 and implemented on an INRAE facility. It aims to permit farmers to live from their dairy cattle system in a context of climate change, while saving water and fossil energy resources and contributing to a sustainable agriculture. It relies on an agroecological approach at the farm level aiming to adapt the whole farm to climate change in a context of low inputs. The system relies on the diversification of forage resources in terms of species (including woody plants) and mixtures, the maximisation of grazing, a larger use of legumes, the recycling of water and nutrients, and also on enhanced interactions between forage, crop and livestock systems. To improve this synergy, the herd reproduction is based on two calving periods centered on spring and autumn, to better link cattle needs with the growth of grasslands, and also to overcome climatic hazards which could occur at one period. The increase of the lactation length and the crossing of dairy breeds are also experimented (cf livestock component).;OaSys.png;https://ferlus.isc.inrae.fr/dispositifs-experimentaux/oasys;OaSys;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCke0yG8EceO0x7gvqluyrMQ;OasYs INRAE Ferlus; https://euraf.isa.utl.pt/files/pub/docs/silvopastoralism_3_novak.pdf;Integrating agroforestry into an innovative mixed crop-dairy system;https://doi.org/10.15454/SRBXQ9;Dispositif agroforestier en systeme laitier a Lusignan

In agroforestry systems, a minimal planting distance of 12 m in-rows and 20 m between rows is advised (e.g. density of 40 trees per ha) because of the broad crown resulting in a lot of shade. ;ChestnutBelgium.png;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10932694;AFINET Innovation Factsheet;;;;;;

62;Orchard grazing;AGFORWARD;Northern Europe;UK;;Grazed orchards;;Apples;;Sheep;The potential benefits from grazing apple orchards with sheep include a reduction in mowing costs and an additional source of grass for the sheep. The sheep can promote nutrient cycling and can benefit from the shelter in winter. However, introducing sheep to an orchard is not suitable in all cases and sometimes it is the wrong thing to do. This leaflet describes some of the issues to consider before introducing sheep.;NE_Grazed_orchards_copyright_Agforward.jpg;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10914612;AGFORWARD Innovation ;;;;;;
63;Economic benefits of grazed apple orchards;AGFORWARD;Northern Europe;UK;;Grazed orchards;;Apples;;Sheep;Orchard grazing can offer financial and environmental benefits. The experience of stakeholders in the AGFORWARD project is that some lowland sheep breeds (e.g. Shropshire) can successfully graze on orchards which have been pruned to a height of 1-2 m without noticeable losses in apple yields. Sheep producers can profit from an additional source of grass in the orchards, and the release of grazed land for hay production. Orchard owners can profit from reduced mowing costs, increased nitrogen cycling and a rent from the sheep owner. There can also be societal benefits in terms of employment and plant biodiversity.;CiderSheep.png;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10914598;AGFORWARD Innovation ;;;;;;
