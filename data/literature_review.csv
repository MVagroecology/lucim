CBSA39JD;2014;"Alam, Mahbubul; Olivier, Alain; Paquette, Alain; Dupras, Jérôme; Revéret, Jean Pierre; Messier, Christian";A general framework for the quantification and valuation of ecosystem services of tree-based intercropping systems;This study provides the first complete framework for the valuation of ecosystem services of agroforestry and uses a tree-based intercropping (TBI) system in southern Québec, Canada, as a case study. Ten ecosystem services were estimated, all of which were of interest and directly applicable to most agricultural systems worldwide: nutrient mineralization, water quality, soil quality, pollination, biological control, air quality, windbreak, timber provisioning, agriculture provisioning, and climate regulation. A mix of mathematical models for the quantification and economic valuation of various ecosystem services were used. The results revealed a total annual margin of $2,645 ha-1 y-1 (averaged over 40 years). The economic value of combined non-market services was $1,634 ha-1 y-1, which was higher than the value of marketable products (i.e. timber and agricultural products). An analysis of the present value suggested that agricultural products ranked highest among the ecosystem services taken singularly, followed by water quality, air quality, climate regulation, and soil quality maintenance. Total economic value of all ecosystem services for the rotation period was $54,782 ha-1, only one third of which was contributed by agricultural products. Although the total value of the ecosystem services provided by TBI was high, farmers only benefited from agricultural and timber products. Thus, government incentives are needed to interest farmers in adopting practices that benefit society as a whole. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.;10.1007/s10457-014-9681-x;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-014-9681-x;x;x;;;;;;;;x;x;;;;x;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;
7J7XB3AL;2015;"Altieri, Miguel A.; Nicholls, Clara I.; Henao, Alejandro; Lana, Marcos A.";Agroecology and the design of climate change-resilient farming systems;"Diverse, severe, and location-specific impacts on agricultural production are anticipated with climate change. The last IPCC report indicates that the rise of CO<inf>2</inf> and associated “greenhouse” gases could lead to a 1.4 to 5.8 °C increase in global surface temperatures, with subsequent consequences on precipitation frequency and amounts. Temperature and water availability remain key factors in determining crop growth and productivity; predicted changes in these factors will lead to reduced crop yields. Climate-induced changes in insect pest, pathogen and weed population dynamics and invasiveness could compound such effects. Undoubtedly, climate- and weather-induced instability will affect levels of and access to food supply, altering social and economic stability and regional competiveness. Adaptation is considered a key factor that will shape the future severity of climate change impacts on food production. Changes that will not radically modify the monoculture nature of dominant agroecosystems may moderate negative impacts temporarily. The biggest and most durable benefits will likely result from more radical agroecological measures that will strengthen the resilience of farmers and rural communities, such as diversification of agroecosytems in the form of polycultures, agroforestry systems, and crop-livestock mixed systems accompanied by organic soil management, water conservation and harvesting, and general enhancement of agrobiodiversity. Traditional farming systems are repositories of a wealth of principles and measures that can help modern agricultural systems become more resilient to climatic extremes. Many of these agroecological strategies that reduce vulnerabilities to climate variability include crop diversification, maintaining local genetic diversity, animal integration, soil organic management, water conservation and harvesting, etc. Understanding the agroecological features that underlie the resilience of traditional agroecosystems is an urgent matter, as they can serve as the foundation for the design of adapted agricultural systems. Observations of agricultural performance after extreme climatic events (hurricanes and droughts) in the last two decades have revealed that resiliency to climate disasters is closely linked to farms with increased levels of biodiversity. Field surveys and results reported in the literature suggest that agroecosystems are more resilient when inserted in a complex landscape matrix, featuring adapted local germplasm deployed in diversified cropping systems managed with organic matter rich soils and water conservation-harvesting techniques. The identification of systems that have withstood climatic events recently or in the past and understanding the agroecological features of such systems that allowed them to resist and/or recover from extreme events is of increased urgency, as the derived resiliency principles and practices that underlie successful farms can be disseminated to thousands of farmers via Campesino a Campesino networks to scale up agroecological practices that enhance the resiliency of agroecosystems. The effective diffusion of agroecological technologies will largely determine how well and how fast farmers adapt to climate change.";10.1007/s13593-015-0285-2;https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-015-0285-2;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;;;;;x;x;x;;

W.; Shepherd, K.; Sinclair, F.";Agroforestry and Soil Health: Linking Trees, Soil Biota, and Ecosystem Services;Agricultural landscapes hold a large proportion of the world's biodiversity. Nevertheless, there is poor understanding of the contribution of agricultural management practices to conservation of biodiversity and soil functions that underpin the provision of soil-based ecosystem services. Evidence has shown a strong link between aboveground and belowground biodiversity, highlighting the impact of land use and management on the provision of soil-based ecosystem services. Agroforestry – the integration of trees into agricultural fields and landscapes – has the potential to facilitate the transition to multifunctional agriculture that successfully addresses the challenge of optimizing crop productivity while maintaining the provision of other ecosystem services. In order to realize this potential, however, there is considerable need for greater understanding of how to optimize tree–soil biota interactions that improve agroecosystem function and soil health.;10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199575923.003.0028;https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199575923.003.0028;;;;;;;;;;x;x;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;;;;;x;x;x;;

N.; Pantera, Anastasia";Agroforestry as a sustainable land use option to reduce wildfires risk in European Mediterranean areas;Wildfires have always been an integral part of the ecology of many terrestrial ecosystems, but their frequency is increasing in many parts of the world. Wildfires were once a natural phenomenon, but after humans learned to control fire, it has been used as a management tool to increase soil fertility, to regenerate natural vegetation for grazing and to control competing vegetation. However, currently uncontrolled wildfires threaten not only natural vegetation, landscape biodiversity, communities and economies, but they also release large amounts of carbon dioxide, thus contributing to global temperature increase. Higher temperatures and drier summers have increased the risk of wildfires in biodiversity rich areas of European Mediterranean countries and have resulted in human casualties. The aim of this article is to investigate whether agroforestry, the practice of integrating woody vegetation and agricultural crops and/or livestock, could be a management tool to reduce wildfires in European Mediterranean countries. Fire events from 2008 to 2017 and data of land cover and land use were spatially correlated. Results indicated that agroforestry areas had fewer wildfire incidents than forests, shrublands or grasslands, providing evidence of the potential of agroforestry to reduce fire risk and protect ecosystems.;10.1007/s10457-020-00482-w;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-020-00482-w;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;southern europe only;
VQN4SGU6;2020;"Sollen-Norrlin, Maya; Ghaley, Bhim Bahadur; Rintoul, Naomi Laura Jane";Agroforestry benefits and challenges for adoption in Europe and beyond;Soil degradation is a global concern, decreasing the soil’s ability to perform a multitude of functions. In Europe, one of the leading causes of soil degradation is unsustainable agricultural practices. Hence, there is a need to explore alternative production systems for enhanced agronomic productivity and environmental performance, such as agroforestry systems (AFS). Given this, the objective of the study is to enumerate the major benefits and challenges in the adoption of AFS. AFS can improve agronomic productivity, carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, soil biodiversity, water retention, and pollination. Furthermore, they can reduce soil erosion and incidence of fire and provide recreational and cultural benefits. There are several challenges to the adoption and uptake of AFS in Europe, including high costs for implementation, lack of financial incentives, limited AFS product marketing, lack of education, awareness, and field demonstrations. Policies for financial incentives such as subsidies and payments for ecosystem services provided by AFS must be introduced or amended. Awareness of AFS products must be increased for consumers through appropriate marketing strategies, and landowners need more opportunities for education on how to successfully manage diverse, economically viable AFS. Finally, field-based evidence is required for informed decision-making by farmers, advisory services, and policy-making bodies.;10.3390/su12177001;https://doi.org/10.3390/su12177001;x;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;;;x;;;;;;;;x;x;;;;;;x;x;;x;x;;x;x;x;;;;;x;x;x;;

Using a transdisciplinary approach, we combined scientific and technical knowledge to evaluate nine environmental pressures in terms of ecosystem services in European farmland and assessed the carbon storage potential of suitable agroforestry systems, proposed by regional experts. First, regions with potential environmental pressures were identified with respect to soil health (soil erosion by water and wind, low soil organic carbon), water quality (water pollution by nitrates, salinization by irrigation), areas affected by climate change (rising temperature), and by underprovision in biodiversity (pollination and pest control pressures, loss of soil biodiversity). The maps were overlaid to identify areas where several pressures accumulate. In total, 94.4% of farmlands suffer from at least one environmental pressure, pastures being less affected than arable lands. Regional hotspots were located in north-western France, Denmark, Central Spain, north and south-western Italy, Greece, and eastern Romania. The 10% of the area with the highest number of accumulated pressures were defined as Priority Areas, where the implementation of agroforestry could be particularly effective. In a second step, European agroforestry experts were asked to propose agroforestry practices suitable for the Priority Areas they were familiar with, and identified 64 different systems covering a wide range of practices. These ranged from hedgerows on field boundaries to fast growing coppices or scattered single tree systems. Third, for each proposed system, the carbon storage potential was assessed based on data from the literature and the results were scaled-up to the Priority Areas. As expected, given the wide range of agroforestry practices identified, the carbon sequestration potentials ranged between 0.09 and 7.29 t C ha −1 a −1 . Implementing agroforestry on the Priority Areas could lead to a sequestration of 2.1 to 63.9 million t C a −1 (7.78 and 234.85 million t CO 2eq a −1 ) depending on the type of agroforestry. This corresponds to between 1.4 and 43.4% of European agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Moreover, promoting agroforestry in the Priority Areas would contribute to mitigate the environmental pressures identified there. We conclude that the strategic and spatially targeted establishment of agroforestry systems could provide an effective means of meeting EU policy objectives on GHG emissions whilst providing a range of other important benefits.;10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.02.025;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.02.025;;;;;;;;;;x;x;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;;x;x;;x;x;x;;;;;x;x;x;;
73WEYIGR;2009;Jose, Shibu;Agroforestry for ecosystem services and environmental benefits: An overview;"Agroforestry systems are believed to provide a number of ecosystem services; however, until recently evidence in the agroforestry literature supporting these perceived benefits has been lacking. This special issue brings together a series of papers from around the globe to address recent findings on the ecosystem services and environmental benefits provided by agroforestry. As prelude to the special issue, this paper examines four major ecosystem services and environmental benefits of agroforestry: (1) carbon sequestration, (2) biodiversity conservation, (3) soil enrichment and (4) air and water quality. Past and present evidence clearly indicates that agroforestry, as part of a multifunctional working landscape, can be a viable land-use option that, in addition to alleviating poverty, offers a number of ecosystem services and environmental benefits. This realization should help promote agroforestry and its role as an integral part of a multifunctional working landscape the world over. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.";10.1007/s10457-009-9229-7;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-009-9229-7;x;;x;;;;;;;x;x;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;;;;;x;x;x;;
RMJ35SZJ;2023;"Rolo, Víctor; Rivest, David; Maillard, Émilie; Moreno, Gerardo";Agroforestry potential for adaptation to climate change: A soil-based perspective;Agricultural systems face several challenges that threaten their capacity to feed the world while maintaining a healthy and functional environment. Climate change, together with soil degradation, biodiversity loss, resource scarcity and invasive species, is a major threat to agricultural systems worldwide. In this context, new practices have been proposed to circumvent or minimize these threats. Yet, these mostly focus on the farm or plant level (e.g., breeding for stress-tolerant species), while frequently overlooking belowground components (e.g., soil organic carbon accrual). By interlinking above- and below-ground components, the likelihood of limiting the negative effects of current threats to agricultural systems can be maximized. This review explores current knowledge regarding agroforestry and its effects on belowground components as a key property in the reducing effects of climate change. We first review tree effects on key soil properties of agricultural systems. We synthesize evidence regarding agroforestry systems response to current environmental threats that are related to climate change. We continue by discussing how soil processes play a fundamental role in the capacity of agroforestry systems to cope with climate change. We conclude by proposing options on how resilience of agroforestry systems could be further enhanced.;10.1111/sum.12932;https://doi.org/10.1111/sum.12932;x;;x;x;;x;x;;;x;x;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;;x;x;;x;x;x;;;;;x;x;x;;

John; Henderson, Gray S.; Garrett, Harold E.";Agroforestry Practices, Runoff, and Nutrient Loss;A paired watershed study consisting of agroforestry (trees plus grass buffer strips), contour strips (grass buffer strips), and control treatments with a corn (Zea mays L.)–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation was used to examine treatment effects on runoff, sediment, and nutrient losses. During the (1991–1997) calibration and subsequent three-year treatment periods, runoff wasmeasured in 0.91- and 1.37-m H-flumes with bubbler flow meters. Composite samples were analyzed for sediment, total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate, and ammonium. Calibration equations developed to predict runoff, sediment, and nutrients losses explained 66 to 97% of the variability between treatment watersheds. The contour strip and agroforestry treatments reduced runoff by 10 and 1% during the treatment period. In both treatments, most runoff reductions occurred in the second and third years after treatment establishment. The contour strip treatment reduced erosion by19%in 1999, while erosion in the agroforestry treatment exceeded the predicted loss. Treatments reduced TP loss by 8 and 17% on contour strip and agroforestry watersheds. Treatments did not result in reductions in TN during the first two years of the treatment period. The contour strip and agroforestry treatments reduced TN loss by 21 and 20%, respectively, during a large precipitation event in the third year. During the third year of treatments, nitrate N loss was reduced 24 and 37% by contour strip and agroforestry treatments. Contour strip and agroforestry man- agement practices effectively reduced nonpoint-source pollution in runoff from a corn–soybean rotation in the clay pan soils of northeast- ern Missouri.;10.2134/jeq2002.1214;https://doi.org/10.2134/jeq2002.1214;;;;x;;;;;;x;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;

This study analyzed the CC mitigation potential of an alley cropping system on crop physiological stresses and growth as compared to a monoculture system. Materials and Methods: Growth of winter durum wheat, cultivated alone (agriculture) and in combination with hybrid walnut (agroforestry), was simulated with the Hi-sAFe agrofo2restry model, as driven by business-as-usual Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections, split into three scenarios, representing Past (1951-1990), Present (1991-2030), and Future (2031-2070) climatic conditions. Crop growth and the occurrence of thermal, nitrogen, and water stresses were analyzed. Results: Cold-related stresses were modest in Past and almost disappeared over time. Heat, drought, and nitrogen stresses increased about twofold from Past to Future, but were reduced by 20-35% in agroforestry, already with medium-sized trees (diameter at breast height (DBH) of about 10-15 cm). Crop yields in agriculture increased from Past to the end of Present and then remained stable. This moderately decreased with tree age in agroforestry (especially in Future). Discussion: The impact of CC on the crop was buffered in agroforestry, especially for the most extreme climatic events. The mitigation of crop microclimate and the increased stability of crop yields highlight the potential of agroforestry as a CC adaptation strategy.;10.3390/agriculture11040356;https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11040356;;;x;;;x;x;;;;x;;;;;x;;x;;;;;x;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;southern europe;

A meta-analysis;AbstractAgroforestry is gaining interest due to its potential in enhancing climate resilience and sustainability of farming systems. In this meta-analysis, the crop yield in agroforestry system compared to the control (sole crop) from thirty-six experimental field trials in Mediterranean countries was assessed. The response variable Wlog(RR) (i.e., the weighted natural logarithm of the response ratio) was analyzed by the 95% confidence intervals of mean and by fitting eight linear mixed models. Fixed effects, namely the tree cover (low, medium, high), the tree species (ash tree, chestnut, cork oak, holm oak, olive, poplar, walnut), and the crop species (alfalfa, barley, durum wheat, faba bean, forage, oat, pasture, pea, winter wheat) were significant (P = 0.030, P = 0.017, and P = 0.014, respectively), while the system type (alley cropping, silvo-arable, silvo-pastoral) was not. Among management practices (variety, pruning, fertilization, irrigation, crop age classes, imposed warming and drought, harvest time), only the fertilization significantly improved the response variable (P = 0.006), while the interaction of pruning × crop species was marginally significant (P = 0.065). Relatively large study heterogeneity was observed (Q = 72.6, I2 = 72%), which is quite common for agronomic meta-analysis. On the contrary, publication bias based on funnel plots and the Trim and Fill method suggested symmetrical distribution of studies. The sensitivity analysis for significant models identified room for improvements. Overall, we observed a negative effect of trees on crop yield that could be ascribed to the competition for light. Nonetheless, facilitation could be expected under extreme climate events, provided that agricultural practices will maximize synergies among tree cover, tree species, crop species, and management. Future works are encouraged to focus on the overall benefit agroforestry can provide at the field and landscape level, along with long-term monitoring to assess the whole lifespan of these systems and other companion planting options and designs in the Mediterranean region.;10.1007/s13593-023-00927-3;https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-023-00927-3;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;x;x;;;;;;;x;;;southern europe;evidence for negative effect of trees on crop yield
UD9NZ4HA;2013;"Dufour, L.; Metay, A.; Talbot, G.; Dupraz, C.";Assessing light competition for cereal production in temperate agroforestry systems using experimentation and crop modelling;"In every agroforestry system, the tree canopy reduces the incident radiation for the crop. However, cereal varieties were selected, and most crop growth models were designed for unshaded conditions, so both may be unsuited to agroforestry conditions and performance. In southern France, durum wheat productivity was monitored over 2 years in an agroforestry system including walnut trees and under artificial shade conditions. Yield components were measured in both full and reduced light conditions. The cereal yield was always decreased by shade; by almost 50% for the heaviest shade conditions (31% of light reduction). The main effect of the shade was the reduction in the number of grains per spike (35% at the most) and in the weight of grains (16% at the most). The mean grain weight was moderately affected, while the protein content was increased in shaded conditions (by up to 38% for artificial shade). Consequently, the protein yield per hectare was less reduced by the shade than the dry matter grain yield. A crop model (STICS) was also used to simulate the crop productivity in full light and shaded conditions, but the crop LAI and the yield components were not correctly simulated in the shade. The simulations emphasized the sensitivity of the wheat grain filling to shade during the critical period, 30 days before flowering, for yield elaboration. Further experimental and modelling studies should take into account the heterogeneity of shade intensity due to the shape of the tree crown, the width of the crop alley and the orientation of the tree rows and the modification of carbon allocation inside the plant. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.";10.1111/jac.12008;https://doi.org/10.1111/jac.12008;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;evidence for negative effect of trees on crop yield

6XDQCSM9;2008;"Fernández, María Elena; Gyenge, Javier; Licata, Julian; Schlichter, Tomás; Bond, Barbara J.";Belowground interactions for water between trees and grasses in a temperate semiarid agroforestry system;"A fundamental hypothesis of agroforestry is the complementary use of soil resources. However, productivity of many agroforestry systems has been lower than expected due to net competition for water, highlighting the need for a mechanistic understanding of belowground interactions. The goal of this study was to examine root-root interactions for water in a temperate semiarid agroforestry system, based on ponderosa pines and a Patagonian grass. The hypotheses were: (a) A greater proportion of water uptake by pines is from deeper soil layers when they are growing with grasses than when they are growing alone; (b) Growth of grasses is improved by the use of water hydraulically lifted by pines. We used stable isotopes of O to analyze water sources of plants, and we measured sapflow direction in pine roots and continuous soil water content with a very sensitive system. We also installed barriers to isolate the roots of a set of grasses from pine roots, in which we measured water status, relative growth and water sources, comparing to control plants. The results indicated that pines and grasses show some complementary in the use of soil water, and that pines in agroforestry systems use less shallow water than pines in monoculture. We found evidence of hydraulic lift, but contradicting results were obtained comparing growth and isotope results of the root isolation experiment. Therefore, we could not reject nor accept that grasses use water that is hydraulically lifted by the pines, or that this results in a positive effect on grass growth. This information may contribute to understand the complex and variable belowground interactions in temperate agroforestry. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.";10.1007/s10457-008-9119-4;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-008-9119-4;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;x;x;x;;

Flammability parameters of Mediterranean shrub species under grazing;In this study, we evaluated changes in the potential flammability of different Mediterranean shrub species in a pine (Pinus pinea) forest in the Doñana Natural Park (of SW Spain) as a result of goat grazing. Plant height, total biomass, fine fuel biomass and leaves/wood ratio were measured in individual plants of each species in both grazed and ungrazed areas. Moisture content, mean time of ignition, mean time of combustion, gross heat of combustion (GHC) and flammability class of the studied shrub species were determined in the laboratory. The results of this experiment showed that grazing influenced the flammability characteristics of the studied shrub species. However, the strength of this effect was insufficient to modify the flammability index of these plants, except in the case of Myrtus communis, in which grazed plants presented a lower flammability index. According to Valette’s classification, Cistus salviifolius, Halimium halimifolium and Pistacea lentiscus are flammable species, Rosmarinus officinalis is a flammable-highly flammable species, and M. communis is non-flammable. The GHC values obtained were generally “intermediate”, except for those of R. officinalis, which were classified as “high”. The flammability parameters of the study species did not show a very marked trend in relation to grazing, but the vertical structure of plants did change by presenting reduced biomass of leaves and fine twigs. This change altered the physical characteristics of these plants and possibly acted to reduce the inherent fire risk of the shrublands.;10.3390/su13031555;https://doi.org/10.3390/su13031555;;;;;;;;;x;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;;;;;;;x;x;x;;

The establishment of hedgerows may be a promising strategy to promote carbon (C) sinks for climate change mitigation. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis compiling data from 83 sites on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks beneath hedgerows in comparison with adjacent croplands and grasslands, plus biomass data from 64 hedgerows. On average (± SD), the establishment of hedgerows on cropland increased SOC stocks by 32 ± 23 %. No significant differences were found between the SOC stocks of hedgerows and those of grassland. The average above-ground biomass stock was 47 ± 29 Mg C ha−1. Only one study reported measurements of below-ground biomass stocks and root/shoot ratios. Based on these measurements, an average below-ground biomass stock of 44 ± 28 Mg C ha−1 was estimated, but with high uncertainty. In total, hedgerows were estimated to store 104 ± 42 Mg ha−1 more C than croplands, with biomass contributing 84 % (87 ± 40 Mg C ha−1) and soil 16 % (17 ± 12 Mg C ha−1) to this amount. Total C sequestration with the establishment of hedgerows on cropland could be between 2.1 and 5.2 Mg ha−1 year−1 for a period of 50 and 20 years, respectively. Our results indicate that C stocks in hedgerows are on average comparable to estimates for forests. The establishment of hedgerows, especially on cropland, can therefore be an effective option for C sequestration in agricultural landscapes while enhancing biodiversity and soil protection.;10.1007/s10113-021-01798-8;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-021-01798-8;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;

Effects on soil and micro-climate;The effects of three methods of clearing a tropical rainforest were investigated for changes in soil physical and chemical properties and micro-climate on an Alfisol in southern Nigeria. The methods consisted of slash, slash and burn, and bulldozing. Deforestation increased the maximum air temperature by 5–8° C and the maximum soil temperature at 1 cm depth by 25° C. Compared with manual clearing, the mechanical method increased soil bulk density and penetration resistance and reduced infiltration rate and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Similarly affected were the moisture retention characteristics, moisture retention at zero suction being 22.0% for mechanical, compared with 30% for manual, clearing. Burning increased soil pH and total soluble salts such as Ca, Mg, and K.;10.1016/0378-4290(79)90012-1;https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-4290(79)90012-1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;

However, none present satisfactory results. In that context, in 1986 the Regional Government of La Rioja started the Plan for Shrub Clearing (PSC), combining shrub clearings and livestock grazing to control fires and improve the land management of abandoned mountain areas. Our study aims to analyse the effects of shrub clearings on forest fires in La Rioja and to compare the main results with those observed in Spain in the last 30 years. We apply an interdisciplinary methodology based on the analysis of the evolution of cleared areas, the evolution of wildfires in La Rioja and Spain, mapping land use and land cover changes, and quantifying the combustibility. Results obtained in La Rioja are very positive compared with the evolution of Spain, both in the reduction of the number of fires and the burned areas. Decreases in the combustible material, fuel load and biomass and in the occurrence of fires (>1 ha) were observed. In addition, clearing shrubland and extensive livestock provided other environmental benefits (i.e. mosaic landscapes, ecosystem services). Finally, this study suggested that they are good and sustainable techniques to prevent and control wildfires and they could be used as a land management strategy in other Mediterranean areas.;10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.08.104;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.08.104;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;x;;;southern Europe;

Towards this aim, three aridity indices were computed for the Iberian Peninsula (IP): the De Martonne Index (DMI), the Pinna Combinative Index (PCI), and the Erinç Aridity Index (EAI). These three indices were first computed for the baseline period 1961–1990, using gridded observational data (E-OBS), and subsequently, for the periods 2011–2040 (short range) and 2041–2070 (medium range), using an ensemble of six regional climate model (RCM) experiments generated by the EURO-CORDEX project. Two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) were analyzed, an intermediate anthropogenic radiative forcing scenario (RCP4.5) and a fossil-intensive emission scenario (RCP8.5). Overall, the three indices disclose a strengthening of aridity and dry conditions in central and southern Iberia until 2070, mainly under RCP8.5. Strong (weak) statistically significant correlations were found between these indices and the total mean precipitation (mean temperature) along with projected significant decreasing (increasing) trends for precipitation (temperature). The prevalence of years with arid conditions (above 70% for 2041–2070 under both RCPs) are projected to have major impacts in some regions, such as southern Portugal, Extremadura, Castilla-La Mancha, Comunidad de Madrid, Andalucía, Región de Murcia, Comunidad Valenciana, and certain regions within the Aragón province. The projected increase in both the intensity and persistence of aridity conditions in a broader southern half of Iberia will exacerbate the exposure and vulnerability of this region to climate change, while the risk of multi-level desertification should be thoroughly integrated into regional and national water management and planning.;10.3390/w13152035;https://doi.org/10.3390/w13152035;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;

68H75BJ3;2019;"Basche, Andrea D.; DeLonge, Marcia S.";Comparing infiltration rates in soils managed with conventional and alternative farming methods: A meta-analysis;Identifying agricultural practices that enhance water cycling is critical, particularly with increased rainfall variability and greater risks of droughts and floods. Soil infiltration rates offer useful insights to water cycling in farming systems because they affect both yields (through soil water availability) and other ecosystem outcomes (such as pollution and flooding from runoff). For example, conventional agricultural practices that leave soils bare and vulnerable to degradation are believed to limit the capacity of soils to quickly absorb and retain water needed for crop growth. Further, it is widely assumed that farming methods such as no-till and cover crops can improve infiltration rates. Despite interest in the impacts of agricultural practices on infiltration rates, this effect has not been systematically quantified across a range of practices. To evaluate how conventional practices affect infiltration rates relative to select alternative practices (no-till, cover crops, crop rotation, introducing perennials, crop and livestock systems), we performed a meta-analysis that included 89 studies with field trials comparing at least one such alternative practice to conventional management. We found that introducing perennials (grasses, agroforestry, managed forestry) or cover crops led to the largest increases in infiltration rates (mean responses of 59.2 ± 20.9% and 34.8 ± 7.7%, respectively). Also, although the overall effect of no-till was non-significant (5.7 ± 9.7%), the practice led to increases in wetter climates and when combined with residue retention. The effect of crop rotation on infiltration rate was non-significant (18.5 ± 13.2%), and studies evaluating impacts of grazing on croplands indicated that this practice reduced infiltration rates (-21.3 ± 14.9%). Findings suggest that practices promoting ground cover and continuous roots, both of which improve soil structure, were most effective at increasing infiltration rates.;10.1371/journal.pone.0215702;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215702;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;;;;;x;x;x;;
8KGJ46SG;2021;"Ivezić, Vladimir; Yu, Yang; Werf, Wopke van der";Crop yields in European agroforestry systems: A meta-analysis;Agroforestry is the practice of integrating woody vegetation with crops and/or livestock production in order to strengthen ecological services on farmland and achieve a more multi-functional agricultural system. Crop yields determine economic outcomes when trees are young, but information on yields is scattered in the literature and a quantitative overview of crop yields in European agroforestry systems is lacking. We therefore synthesized published information on crop yields in European agroforestry systems, using meta-analysis. A systematic review of the literature was conducted, highlighting quantitative information on yields is available only for traditional Dehesa systems in Spain and Portugal and for modern alley cropping experiments, mostly in northern Europe. Relative cereal crop yields in alley cropping systems (systems with tree rows with interspersed crop strips) were 96% of sole crop yield at tree planting. Crop yields in alley cropping decreased on average with 2.6% per year over the first 21 years of the tree stand, indicating increasing competitive effects of the trees with their age. On the other hand, studies in traditional Dehesa and Montado systems in Southern Europe showed no negative influence of the trees on crop production, indicating that competition between crops and trees plays a less important role in those systems than in alley cropping. Overall, the systematic review showed a need for more experimental data to further substantiate the benefits of agroforestry and elucidate optimal agroforestry practices under European conditions.;10.3389/fsufs.2021.606631;https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2021.606631;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;;;;;x;;;;;;;x;x;x;;yield meta analysis - evidence of competition

To solve this issue, crop–livestock integration may be organized beyond the farm level. For instance, local groups of farmers can negotiate land-use allocation patterns and exchange materials such as manure, grain, and straw. Development of such a collective agricultural system raises questions, rarely documented in the literature, about how to integrate crops and livestock among farms, and the consequences, impacts, and conditions of integrating them. Here, we review the different forms of crop–livestock integration beyond the farm level, their potential benefits, and the features of decision support systems (DSS) needed for the integration process. We identify three forms of crop–livestock integration beyond the farm level: local coexistence, complementarity, and synergy, each with increasingly stronger temporal, spatial, and organizational coordination among farms. We claim that the forms of integration implemented define the nature, area, and spatial configuration of crops, grasslands, and animals in farms and landscapes. In turn, these configurations influence the provision of ecosystem services. For instance, we show that the synergy form of integration promotes soil fertility, erosion control, and field-level biological regulation services through organizational coordination among farmers and spatiotemporal integration between crops, grasslands, and animals. We found that social benefits of the synergy form of integration include collective empowerment of farmers. We claim that design of the complementarity and synergy forms of crop–livestock integration can best be supported by collective participatory workshops involving farmers, agricultural consultants, and researchers. In these workshops, spatialized simulation modeling of crop–livestock integration among farms is the basis for achieving the upscaling process involved in integrating beyond the farm level. Facilitators of these workshops have to pay attention to the consequences on governance and equity issues within farmers groups.;10.1007/s13593-016-0390-x;https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-016-0390-x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;x;;;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;;;x;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;;

YR6D4KLF;2017;"Ryschawy, Julie; Martin, Guillaume; Moraine, Marc; Duru, Michel; Therond, Olivier";Designing crop–livestock integration at different levels: Toward new agroecological models?;Integrated crop–livestock systems have been shown to improve nutrient cycling, particularly by re-coupling nitrogen and carbon cycles. Yet the number of mixed crop–livestock farms has been falling steadily in Europe. Integration between crops and livestock at the local level, through exchanges between already specialised farms, is rarely implemented. Given the lack of knowledge on new ways to maintain or to reintegrate crops and livestock from the farm up to the local level, concrete guidelines are needed. In this paper, we developed a transversal analysis of three complementary case studies regarding development of crop–livestock integration at the farm and beyond farm level. To this aim, we reviewed three French case studies in which participatory approaches were used to design scenarios of crop–livestock integration. When crop–livestock integration disappears from the farm level due to labour organisation, exchanges between specialised crop farmers and livestock farmers is a way to redevelop such integration at the local level. Transversal analysis of case-studies allowed us to suggest guidelines for further research regarding the design of agroecological crop–livestock integration. Articulating options of change at farm level and collective level allows to consider the appropriate level of design and trade-offs between (1) farm and beyond farm level, and (2) social, environmental and economic dimensions. Considering these different levels of organisation is needed to identify possible pathways to and policy incentives for integrated crop–livestock systems. Developing specific Decision Support Systems and participative research is needed to conceive locally adapted scenarios of crop-livestock integration.;10.1007/s10705-016-9815-9;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10705-016-9815-9;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;;gives three case studies for France
S3YHSJ7Q;2015;"Pham, Ha T.; Miyagawa, Shuichi; Kosaka, Yasuyuki";Distribution patterns of trees in paddy field landscapes in relation to agro-ecological settings in northeast Thailand;Deforestation accompanied by the expansion of agricultural land makes tree resources less available in many regions in the tropics, and small-scale farmers often incorporate trees with agricultural lands to meet their demands for food, timber, fuelwood, or fodder. This study analyzed the distribution patterns and management of multiple tree species grown in the rice paddy fields of a forest-depleted region in northeast Thailand – a region whose forestland represents only 16.32% of the total land area. Twenty villages from 11 provinces were selected for the remote sensing analysis of tree density and microhabitat. Interview surveys were conducted among villagers on their tree use and management, and field observations were performed to determine tree species’ composition. The average tree-unit density (based on the number of tree crowns, either of a single tree or of cohesive trees, appearing in satellite images) was 6.27 units/ha, and was correlated with both density on the levee (5.30 units/ha on average) and levee length per unit paddy area (475.25 m/ha on average). The levees were more significant as tree habitats in the villages on the floodplain where the early introduction of agricultural machinery and direct seeding reduced the number of trees inside the fields where rice crops are grown. In total, 79 tree species representing 66 genera and 33 families were observed in the paddy fields. Remnant trees from the original forest, mostly Dipterocarpaceae and Fabaceae, have decreased due to cutting for use as timber and fuel. More recently, eucalypt and teak for timber, and mango and tamarind for edible fruits, have been planted on the levees as income sources. Farmers have recognized that while leaf litter fertilizes the soil, excess shading reduces the rice yield. The coppicing of eucalypt and pollarding of Mitragyna diversifolia were conducted for the sustainable harvest of timber and fuelwood, and also to avoid creating excess shade. Paddy rice fields are the monoculture of a staple crop, but they can harbor multiple trees on their levees, which play a counteractive role in forestland decline.;10.1016/j.agee.2014.12.011;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2014.12.011;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;paddy fields in teh tropics

DXHNNDWR;2016;"Torralba, Mario; Fagerholm, Nora; Burgess, Paul J.; Moreno, Gerardo; Plieninger, Tobias";Do European agroforestry systems enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services? A meta-analysis;Agroforestry has been proposed as a sustainable agricultural system over conventional agriculture and forestry, conserving biodiversity and enhancing ecosystem service provision while not compromising productivity. However, the available evidence for the societal benefits of agroforestry is fragmented and does often not integrate diverse ecosystem services into the assessment. To upscale existing case-study insights to the European level, we conducted a meta-analysis on the effects of agroforestry on ecosystem service provision and on biodiversity levels. From 53 publications we extracted a total of 365 comparisons that were selected for the meta-analysis. Results revealed an overall positive effect of agroforestry (effect size = 0.454, p < 0.01) over conventional agriculture and forestry. However, results were heterogeneous, with differences among the types of agroforestry practices and ecosystem services assessed. Erosion control, biodiversity, and soil fertility are enhanced by agroforestry while there is no clear effect on provisioning services. The effect of agroforestry on biomass production is negative. Comparisons between agroforestry types and reference land-uses showed that both silvopastoral and silvoarable systems increase ecosystem service provision and biodiversity, especially when compared with forestry land. Mediterranean tree plantation systems should be especially targeted as soil erosion could be highly reduced while soil fertility increased. We conclude that agroforestry can enhance biodiversity and ecosystem service provision relative to conventional agriculture and forestry in Europe and could be a strategically beneficial land use in rural planning if its inherent complexity is considered in policy measures.;10.1016/j.agee.2016.06.002;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2016.06.002;x;;x;x;;;;;;x;x;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;;x;x;;x;x;x;;;;;x;x;x;;

This paper reviews the scientific literature regarding the dynamic role and importance of plant, fungal and ruminant communities in Mediterranean wood-pastures and assesses the favorable and unfavorable aspects of their occurrence through grazing management. The grasslands of the Mediterranean region play an important role both in forage material production and the conservation of biodiversity in plant communities and at the landscape level. These two management purposes are not conflicting but complementary when the management is based upon the knowledge of the effect of grazing on the ecology of these ecosystems. Conclusively, vascular plant, fungal and ruminant communities have a strong influence on ecosystem structure and functioning and they play a key role in many ecological services. Hence, integrated studies which combine multi-level ecological research are essential in order to identify regional and/or national needs in terms of biodiversity, genetic resources, sustainable rural development and conservation policies.;10.3390/su131810179;https://doi.org/10.3390/su131810179;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;x;;;southern Europe;

On the same field, the sustainable production of food and biomass is possible, while simultaneously, especially in marginal areas, the ecological function of the landscape can be improved. Thus, alley cropping corresponds with the increasing demand for renewable energy resources and for a specific adaptation to the predicted changes of climatic conditions within Central Europe. However, presently, little knowledge exists regarding the effects of alley cropping on the environment. In this study a literature survey was undertaken to provide an overview of the different ecological benefits arising from alley cropping systems within temperate Europe. Abiotic factors (nutrient cycle, microclimate), biotic factors (biodiversity) and the effects on the carbon cycle are discussed in detail. Summarising, the results showed that alley cropping may be an ecologically advantageous land use system for sustainable food and biomass production in comparison with conventional agricultural practices. As a very flexible, but low-input system, alley cropping can supply biomass resources in a sustainable way and at the same time provide ecological benefits. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective was to assess the potential of these domestic bird species as biological control agents. Four insect pests were studied: plum curculio, apple maggot, Japanese beetle, and Colorado potato beetle. Chickens fed on several potential crop pests, including Japanese beetle. Although Japanese beetles were less abundant on apple trees when chickens were present, the proportion of damaged fruit was not reduced. Furthermore, chickens did not affect weed abundance or crop productivity. In contrast, geese were effective weeders. Their activities reduced weed abundance and increased potato plant growth and yields compared with a minimally weeded control. In addition, the activities of geese indirectly reduced apple fruit damage by plum curculio and increased the proportion of pest-free fruit, possibly because removal of vegetation by the geese reduced humidity at the soil surface and therefore reduced the activity of plum curculio.;10.1017/s0889189300006718;https://doi.org/10.1017/s0889189300006718;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;x;;;;x;;;;;x;x;x;;

As a consequence, fire management has moved to defensive strategies with a focus only on the known risks (the fear trap). In this region, wildfires can change rapidly, increasing the uncertainty and causing complex operational scenarios that impact society right from the initial hours. To address this challenge, proactive approaches are an alternative to defensive and reactive strategies.We propose a methodology that integrates the uncertainty of decisions and the cost of each opportunity into the strategic decision-making process. The methodology takes into account values such as fire-fighting safety, organizational resilience, landscape resilience, and social values.Details of the methods and principles used to develop and implement a creative decision-making process that empower the fireline are provided. A tool that segregates the landscape into polygons of fire potential and defines the connectivity between those polygons is used. Two examples of operational implementation of this methodology are presented (2014 Tivissa Fire and 2015 Odena Fire).These methods facilitate the analysis of possible scenarios of resolution and the costs of the opportunities that help build resilient emergency response systems and prevent their collapse. Moreover, they help explain the risk to society and involve citizens in the decision-making process. These methods are based on the experience and lessons learned by European incident commanders, managers, and researchers collected during the last decade.;10.1186/s42408-019-0048-6;https://doi.org/10.1186/s42408-019-0048-6;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;assessing fire risk - can't see a link to AF

However, it is somewhat controversial and there is limited evidence regarding its efficacy in semiarid regions. Here we describe studies on jujube agroforestry regimes using two different cash crops: the annual fodder species rape (Brassica napus) and the perennial daylily (Hemerocallis fulva). The jujube agroforestry systems were characterized with respect to their interspecific water interactions and their responses to extreme natural drought using stable isotopic techniques and in situ soil water observations in China’s semiarid Loess Plateau region. We found that agroforestry altered the jujube trees’ water sources but its impact depended on soil wetness: compared to monocultures, jujube trees in agroforestry systems generally shifted to deeper water under dry conditions but to shallower water under wet conditions. Complementary water use between jujube trees and crops was observed on most sampling dates, but there was clear evidence of water competition in the shallow layer under relatively wet conditions. Furthermore, a simple index, Relative Difference in Soil Water content (RDSW), was developed to indicate interspecific water interactions under various wetness conditions. It was found that facilitative interspecific interactions were clearly enhanced in both agroforestry systems during extreme drought. In addition, jujube yields in agroforestry systems were clearly higher than in monoculture. These findings demonstrate that agroforestry is a climate-smart agricultural system and can increase the resilience of semiarid jujube plantations to extreme real-world drought.;10.1016/j.agee.2018.07.001;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.07.001;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;china

This information ranges from climate scenarios, geographical site information, socio-economic data and several possible adaptation measures. Thus, there is an urgent need to have a framework that is capable of organizing adaptation strategies and measures in the agriculture and forestry sectors in Mediterranean climatic regions. Additionally, this framework should provide a cause effect relation with climate vulnerability to adequately support the development of adaptation planning at municipal and local (farm) level. In this context, we propose to test and evaluate a framework for climate adaptation of the agriculture and forestry sectors, based on the local causal-effect relation between adaptation strategies and measures and the level of vulnerability reduction achieved for Mediterranean areas. The framework was developed based on the combination of the DPSIR (Driving forces, Pressures, State, Impacts, Responses) and Vulnerability frameworks and reviewed 162 practical adaptation measures, further organized into strategies, complemented by a set of efficacy indicators. The framework was tested with 70 stakeholders in six stakeholder workshops for the planning of two farms and one municipal climate adaptation study, that are now in actual implementation and monitoring. The framework is composed by a set of eight adaptation strategies in which adaptation measures are clustered and assessed using efficacy indicators. In the evaluation of the adaptation framework, 96% of stakeholders considered its content as good or very good and 89% considered the final outcomes as good or very good. Finally, the framework was also used to assess and compare the adaptation strategies and measures presented in the climate adaptation plans of the three case studies. On average, 52.2% of the adaptation measures selected by the three case studies are dedicated to Ecosystem Resilience, 30.9% to Adaptive Capacity, 9.1% to Microclimates, 7.4% to Protection, and 0.3% to Mitigation strategies. This framework was considered effective in supporting adaptation planning at farm and municipal levels and useful to assess and compare adaptation plans in the frame of vulnerability reduction. Future studies can further contribute to support adaptation planning in these sectors by using, developing and streamlining this framework to additional and different socio-ecological contexts.;10.3390/land10020161;https://doi.org/10.3390/land10020161;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;;;;
TAQVLZ8P;2006;"Aspelmeier, Stella; Leuschner, Christoph";Genotypic variation in drought response of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth): Leaf and root morphology and carbon partitioning;This study investigates the drought response of four genotypes of Betula pendula with a focus on leaf and root morphological traits, leaf phenology and carbon partitioning between shoot and root. Potted one-year-old clonal plants of four genotypes from regions with low to high annual rainfall (550-1270 mm year-1) were subjected to drought periods of 12-14 weeks in two subsequent years. Well-watered control plants of the four genotypes differed significantly with respect to total leaf area per plant (LA) and specific leaf area (SLA), whereas differences in total fine root surface area (RA), root specific area (SRA), and the fine root:leaf mass ratio (FR:LM) were not significant. Highest LA and SLA were found in the clone originating from the driest environment. In complementary physiological investigations this clone was found to have the highest water use as well which was interpreted as competitive superiority in terms of water consumption. Drought resulted in an increase in SLA in all genotypes, and a decrease in LA. Leaf area reduction was more pronounced in the genotypes from high than in those from low rainfall origin. The ratio of total root to leaf surfaces remained more or less constant after drought application despite an increase in FR:LM. This is explained by a decrease in SRA resulting from a reduced abundance of very small fine rootlets (diameter <0.2 mm) in the drought-treated plants. The loss in total root surface area due to a reduction in finest root mass was compensated for by a relative increase in total root dry mass per plant. Comparison of results from the first and second drought period indicated a marked influence of timing of drought, root system size, and putative root limitation on plant drought response. We conclude that leaf and root morphology, the total leaf and root surfaces, and the morphological response to drought in birch are to a large extent under genetic control. © Springer-Verlag 2005.;10.1007/s00468-005-0011-9;https://doi.org/10.1007/s00468-005-0011-9;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;;

An assessment of positive and negative aspects by stakeholders;Whilst the benefits of agroforestry are widely recognised in tropical latitudes few studies have assessed how agroforestry is perceived in temperate latitudes. This study evaluates how stakeholders and key actors including farmers, landowners, agricultural advisors, researchers and environmentalists perceive the implementation and expansion of agroforestry in Europe. Meetings were held with 30 stakeholder groups covering different agroforestry systems in 2014 in eleven EU countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom). In total 344 valid responses were received to a questionnaire where stakeholders were asked to rank the positive and negative aspects of implementing agroforestry in their region. Improved biodiversity and wildlife habitats, animal health and welfare, and landscape aesthetics were seen as the main positive aspects of agroforestry. By contrast, increased labour, complexity of work, management costs and administrative burden were seen as the most important negative aspects. Overall, improving the environmental value of agriculture was seen as the main benefit of agroforestry, whilst management and socio-economic issues were seen as the greatest barriers. The great variability in the opportunities and barriers of the systems suggests enhanced adoption of agroforestry across Europe will be most likely to occur with specific initiatives for each type of system.;10.1007/s10457-017-0116-3;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-017-0116-3;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;;;;;x;x;x;;

It is considered more critical than other factors that limit plant growth and also affects many fundamental biophysical processes. New strategies are needed to overcome drought and to maintain environmental sustainability. Hydraulic lift (HL) or hydraulic redistribution (HR) processes are one of these strategies found in soil–plant systems, but their effects on crop production and the environment have not been well documented. This article reviews (1) the process of HL, (2) methods showing evidence of HL using soil water potential (Ψs) and sap flow techniques, (3) hydraulically-lifting plants, and (4) practical implications for society. The HL is whereby soil water may be transported upward by deep roots of trees and grasses from the moist region (subsurface) to dry region (surface) at night. Thus, HL provides water to areas planted to shallow rooted plants at the upper soil layers. The HL of water by roots from wet to dry soil layers is a potential approach for better use of water resources for crop/grass growth. Also, increases in soil water by HL improve root growth and function which include soil carbon decomposition or nutrient mineralization rates, and this can probably be associated in nutrient cycling. Another benefit is that mycorrhizal fungi play a relevant role in HL and in the redistribution of this water among plants. Thus, HL provides many soil, agricultural, and environmental benefits.;10.1007/s10457-021-00614-w;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-021-00614-w;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;;;;;x;x;x;;

Pasture quality is particularly sensitive to these global-change drivers, but there are still many gaps to broaden knowledge about the interactive effects of both factors on it. In addition, scattered trees might play a relevant role in maintaining high levels of pasture quality under future scenarios of higher aridity, but its role remains largely unexplored. Methods We designed a field manipulative experiment of rainfall exclusion and increased temperature aimed to evaluate the impact of forecasted climate on pasture quality under different historical grazing intensities. To test the potential buffering effect of trees, experimental plots were installed equally in two habitat types: under trees and open grassland. Results Warming reduced the nutrient concentration of pasture, while drought increased it. Tree canopy improved soil fertility, which translated into an increase in pasture quality. Livestock exclusion and high grazing intensity caused a decrease in pasture quality, whereas moderate grazing intensity exerted positive effects on it. Finally, warming beneath tree canopy negatively affected the P concentration of pasture, specifically in the site subjected to moderate grazing intensity. Conclusion Our findings suggest that communities subjected to moderate grazing are more sensitive to climate change from a nutritional standpoint, likely because this management type provides high levels of P to the soil. In addition, we highlight the essential role of trees in agroforestry ecosystems to maintain high values of nutritional quality of pasture.;10.1007/s11104-023-05986-9;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11104-023-05986-9;;;;;;x;x;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;x;x;x;;

Within this framework, in a two-year trial conducted at INRAE in Southern France, the dynamics of microclimatic parameters and the edaphic environment of durum wheat were investigated under a yearly-pruned (AF) and a never-pruned (AF+) 6-m apart alley olive orchard, in comparison with controls under full sun. Here it was recorded a reduction of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) by 30% and 51% in AF and AF+, respectively, during the wheat cycle, together with a marked reduction of wind speed compared to controls (–85% in AF and -99% in AF+). A significant buffer effect was also highlighted for air temperature, averagely +1.7 °C during the night and -3.2 °C during the daytime under the moderate shading of AF. The positive effect of trees on soil water conservation increased with the intensity of shading, particularly during the critical wheat stage of grain filling, with benefits on wheat root mycorrhization, and NH4+ and NO3- abundance in the arable layer. Despite some of the environmental modifications being favorable for the understorey wheat, these were not translated into yield improvements, suggesting that the severe shading associated with the small inter-row and evergreen trees has a prevailing effect, that requires to be managed through appropriate tree pruning.;10.3390/agronomy12020527;https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12020527;;;x;;x;x;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;x;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;reduced crop yield

According to many studies, climate change and abandonment of traditional anthropogenic activities are directly linked to this phenomenon. However, the interaction of these two factors with pseudo-alpine grasslands has not been studied in Greece. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of climatic change and abandonment of transhumant livestock grazing on pseudo-alpine grassland ecosystems structure and stability in Mt Vermio and Mt Zireia. Geographic Information System data on land use/land cover from 1945 and 2020, as well as climatological and livestock data, have been examined and presented. Landscape metrics were also used to quantify landscape structure changes. Although both mountains’ pseudo-alpine grasslands have reduced in size, Mt Zireia has experienced an upward treeline shift, which seems to be the result of climate change, while in Mt Vermio, the more severe transhumance abandonment caused horizontal tree expansion. There are strong indications that a rise in temperature is the main driver for the upward increase in treeline.;10.3390/land11122126;https://doi.org/10.3390/land11122126;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;;;;;;;x;x;x;;
NRRYRYPH;2020;"Jordon, Matthew W.; Willis, Kathy J.; Harvey, William J.; Petrokofsky, Leo; Petrokofsky, Gillian";Implications of temperate agroforestry on sheep and cattle productivity, environmental impacts and enterprise economics. A systematic evidence map;The environmental impacts of ruminant livestock farming need to be mitigated to improve the sustainability of food production. These negative impacts have been compounded by the increased spatial and cultural separation of farming and forestry across multiple temperate landscapes and contexts over recent centuries, and could at least in part be alleviated by re-integration of livestock and trees via agroforestry systems. Such integration also has the potential to benefit the productivity and economics of livestock farming. However, the delivery of hoped-for benefits is highly likely to depend on context, which will necessitate the consideration of local synergies and trade-offs. Evaluating the extensive body of research on the synergies and trade-offs between agroforestry and environmental, productivity and economic indicators would provide a resource to support context-specific decision making by land managers. Here, we present a systematic evidence map of academic and grey literature to address the question “What are the impacts of temperate agroforestry systems on sheep and cattle productivity, environmental impacts and farm economic viability?”. We followed good practice guidance from the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence to find and select relevant studies to create an interactive systematic map. We identified 289 relevant studies from 22 countries across temperate regions of North and South America, Australasia and Europe. Our preliminary synthesis indicates that there is an emerging evidence base to demonstrate that temperate agroforestry can deliver environmental and economic benefits compared with pasture without trees. However, to date measures of livestock productivity (particularly weather-related mortality and heat- and cold-stress) have received insufficient attention in many temperate agroforestry systems. The evidence base assembled through this work provides a freely accessible resource applicable across temperate regions to support context-specific decision making.;10.3390/f11121321;https://doi.org/10.3390/f11121321;;;x;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;x;;;;;;x;;;x;;x;x;x;x;;;;;x;x;x;;

This study aimed to compare the thermal comfort indices in grass monoculture and integrated systems. The three systems were pasture under full sunlight (PFS), integrated (triple-row) livestock-forestry (ILFT), and integrated (single-row) livestock-forestry (ILFs), across four seasons, for two years, from June 2017 to June 2019. We assessed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), air temperature, relative humidity, black globe temperature, and wind speed. Thermal comfort indices such as temperature-humidity index (THI), black globe temperature-humidity index (BGHI), and radiant thermal load (RTL) were calculated based on microclimate data daily-collected from 8:00 to 16:00. The ILFT mean THI (76.8) was slightly lower than ILFS and PFS. The BGHI and RTL values decreased as shading increased (PFS > ILFs > ILFT). The most challenging heat stress conditions for grazing animals occurred predominately during winter and autumn. In conclusion, the presence of trees in pastures of the southern Amazon improved the microclimate and, consequently, the thermal comfort indices. Agroforestry systems can foster an environment with a more suitable thermal comfort or less restrictive to animal performance, which contribute to mitigating global climate change for forage-livestock systems in Brazilian Amazon.;10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102636;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102636;;;x;;;x;x;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;x;x;;;;;;;x;x;x;;

Silvopastoral systems are an alternative; however, the relation between animal welfare and tree coverage has been poorly studied. We hypothesized that a connection between these features exist and that its evaluation can influence system management decisions. A general assessment of tree coverage percentage and tree distribution in ten Mexican cattle ranches was performed using satellite images. Animal welfare indicators from the Welfare Quality® dairy cattle protocol measurable in extensive conditions were also assessed. Tree coverage percentage was highly variable and formed a gradient (52.42% in Ranch J2 to 2.00% in Ranch S1). The tree coverage percentage of two ranches was deemed as silvopastoral (between 22 and 35%). Body condition was better in ranches with high tree coverage compared to those with low (P < 0.05). The percentage of wooded grassland was negatively correlated with flight distance reductions (P < 0.05). Less integument alterations were present in high tree coverage ranches compared to low (P < 0.05). Our landscape analysis showed the presence of different vegetal compositions in silvopastoral systems of the Mexican tropics. This knowledge can be applied to improve management decisions and promote the use of silvopastoral systems in the area. Additionally, this is the first study proving a relationship between landscape structure and welfare indicators, since body condition and integument alterations were positively affected. Although our results need further research, similar analyses can be implemented to improve cattle well-being in production systems associated to trees. In conclusion, landscape analysis in combination with animal welfare measurements could increase productivity by identifying important links between cattle welfare and the presence of trees, as well as help to identify areas of further research for the implementation of silvopastoral systems in Mexico.";10.1007/s13593-018-0497-3;https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-018-0497-3;;x;x;;;x;x;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;x;x;x;x;;;;;x;x;x;;

This paper reviews the ecological and ecophysiological bases for interspecific interactions based on data from site-specific research and demonstration trials from temperate agroforestry systems, primarily from temperate North America. The review shows that information on ecological interactions in several temperate agroforestry systems is inadequate. It is recommended that the future research should focus on exploring new species and systems that have received little attention in the past. Priority research areas should include cultural practices and system designs to minimize interspecific competition and maximize environmental benefits such as improved water quality. Potential for genetic modification of components to increase productivity and reduce competition also needs to be explored.

However, climate change is causing more frequent and severe drought events, accompanied by warmer temperatures, collectively threatening the persistence of these groundwater dependent ecosystems through a combination of increasing evaporative demand and decreasing groundwater supply. We conducted a dendro-isotopic analysis of radial growth and seasonal (semi-annual) carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13 C) to investigate the response of riparian cottonwood stands to the unprecedented California-wide drought from 2012 to 2019, along the largest remaining free-flowing river in Southern California. Our goals were to identify principal drivers and indicators of drought stress for dryland riparian woodlands, determine their thresholds of tolerance to hydroclimatic stressors, and ultimately assess their vulnerability to climate change. Riparian trees were highly responsive to drought conditions along the river, exhibiting suppressed growth and strong stomatal closure (inferred from reduced Δ13 C) during peak drought years. However, patterns of radial growth and Δ13 C were quite variable among sites that differed in climatic conditions and rate of groundwater decline. We show that the rate of groundwater decline, as opposed to climate factors, was the primary driver of site differences in drought stress, and trees showed greater sensitivity to temperature at sites subjected to faster groundwater decline. Across sites, higher correlation between radial growth and Δ13 C for individual trees, and higher inter-correlation of Δ13 C among trees were indicative of greater drought stress. Trees showed a threshold of tolerance to groundwater decline at 0.5 m year-1 beyond which drought stress became increasingly evident and severe. For sites that exceeded this threshold, peak physiological stress occurred when total groundwater recession exceeded ~3 m. These findings indicate that drought-induced groundwater decline associated with more extreme droughts is a primary threat to dryland riparian woodlands and increases their susceptibility to projected warmer temperatures.;10.1111/gcb.16376;https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16376;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;

Because Mediterranean forests are an important source of natural capital, they can significantly contribute to the achievement of forest-related global goals, provided that their specific features are considered. One such specificity is that the value of Mediterranean forests lies more in their non-wood forest products and services than in their wood products. Forest-based solutions to address SDGs would thus need to rely on those products and services and acknowledge their true value, especially with regard to ecosystem services that are often treated as externalities. Another specificity of Mediterranean forests is their connection to other sectors and to local communities, thus making landscape and participatory approaches, such as forest and landscape restoration, particularly relevant for the region. Enabling conditions for Mediterranean forests to contribute to the achievement of SDGs includes the alignment of regional and national policies and strategies on global goals. It also requires forest monitoring systems to be established.;;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63625-8_28;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;x;;;;x;x;;;;x;;;x;;;;;;;;x;;;;

Patras) in direct comparison to a common agricultural crop system. Microclimate was measured at nine positions distributed at the SRACS and an adjacent open field in Brandenburg State (Germany) from March to August 2016. Our hypothesis was that microclimate and AED was improved at SRACS, with traceable effects on the crop yield. The analysis of air temperature and water vapour deficit (VPD) data revealed significantly (p ≤ 0.05) lower daytime values from June to August at the crop alley of the SRACS, which were generally most frequent at the poplar hedgerow and 3 m west positions. By contrast, wind speed was reduced at almost all the positions of our crop alley and during the entire measurement period during both day and night. The AED measured on sampling days in July was significantly (p ≤ 0.001) reduced at the whole crop alley, with values from 24 to 32% in comparison to the open field. We observed a strong linear relationship (R2 ≈ 0.78–0.99) between AED on one side and wind speed and VPD on the other side. The average grain yield within the SRACS was 16% higher than on the OF. However, our microclimate data were insufficient to explain this yield surplus.;10.1007/s10457-018-0289-4;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-018-0289-4;;x;x;;;x;x;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;

Microclimatic parameters (air temperature, soil temperature at 5- and 10-cm depths, wind speed, gust speed, wind direction, humidity, dew point, rainfall, soil-moisture content, total solar radiation, and photosynthetically active radiation) were collected from November 2005 to January 2008 using HOBO© weather stations located in each pasture type. Data were analyzed to determine overall, as well as seasonal, monthly, and diurnal differences between pasture types. Evapotranspiration was calculated from air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and total solar radiation. The overall average values for all microclimatic parameters were lower in silvopasture compared to open-pasture. Seasonal, monthly, and diurnal differences between pasture types were also detected for several parameters. These results indicate that milder microclimatic conditions occur in silvopasture versus open-pasture on the Coastal Plain of the Southeast USA.;10.1007/s10457-014-9768-4;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-014-9768-4;;x;x;x;x;x;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;;;;;;;x;x;x;;

Alley cropping, which is the inclusion of rows of trees and shrubs in agricultural land, could enhance the resilience of cropping systems, as these systems are expected to positively modify the microclimate and water balance of croplands. This review analyses the effect of alley cropping on the microclimate and water balance, based on the available evidence from temperate alley cropping systems. Within alley cropping systems, the tree rows generate gradients in microclimatic variables, whereby strongest effects are observed in or close to the tree rows. Field-scale studies on light intensity (n=20), wind speed (n=4) and surface runoff (n=3) all reported a reduction compared to sole cropping systems. Effects on air temperature (n=10), relative humidity (n=5) and evapotranspiration (n=6) varied among studies, with the majority reporting a decrease in daytime temperatures (50% of studies), variable effects on relative humidity (60%) and an increase in evapotranspiration (50%) due to higher evapotranspiration by trees. Highest variation among studies was found for soil moisture, with 41% of studies reporting temporal and spatial differences within the system. This variation among studies likely depends on the purpose of the trees (short rotation coppice vs. fruit and/or timber trees) and design of the system. Also site context, such as topography, landscape diversity and climate, could play a role, but these factors are rarely taken into account. Only few studies investigated landscape-scale effects (n=3), such as groundwater recharge and moisture recycling. Future research should investigate the role of site context in the functioning of alley cropping systems and quantify landscape-scale effects. The process understanding gained from those studies will contribute to designing alley cropping systems that enhance the climate change resilience of current central European cropping systems.;10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.109065;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.109065;x;x;x;;;;x;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;
KUTS7W3K;2007;"Ryszkowski, Lech; Kedziora, Andrzej";Modification of water flows and nitrogen fluxes by shelterbelts;The introduction of shelterbelts (mid-field trees linear structures) in a uniform agricultural landscape composed mainly of cultivated fields is one of the best tools for managing heat balance and water regime in the landscape. Evapotranspiration rates, surface runoff and percolation of water across a soil profile are controlled by shelterbelts. The heat transfers from cultivated fields to shelterbelts by advection processes enhance evapotranspiration rates from trees. Depth of groundwater table and thermal conditions have important bearing on the uptake of groundwater by trees. The studies showed that in the Turew agricultural landscape, located near Poznan, Poland, shelterbelts use for evapotranspiration 40 percent more water than cultivated fields. For air heating cultivated fields use 280 percent of solar energy more than shelterbelts. The shelterbelts limit N-NO3- spreading with groundwater very effectively. Concentrations of inflowing nitrates with groundwater dropped to 2.3-24.4 percent of the input from fields. In contrast to nitrate ions the ammonium behave entirely different. Often concentration of ammonium increased in groundwater under shelterbelts. Higher concentrations of N-NH4+ under shelterbelts than under field indicated that ammonium ions were released during decomposition of organic matter. This supposition was directly proved by estimates of very high rates of urease activity which enzyme converts urea nitrogen into NH3 in the final stages of protein decomposition. It was estimated that N2O fluxes from soil of shelterbelts are much smaller than from cultivated fields. The balance of nitrogen inputs and outputs in a shelterbelt indicated that the internal recycling of this element is of crucial importance for the controlling efficiency of nitrogen compounds spreading in an environment. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is great variability in the observed effects within and between studies. Also, little is known about the simultaneous delivery of multiple ecosystem services and biodiversity because most studies focus on monitoring one service at a time and in conditions specifically suited to observe this one service. In this study, the results are presented of 1 year of monitoring of a set of parcel-level and simplistic ecosystem service and biodiversity indicators on parcels with grass strips or hedgerows. In the grass strips, an increase in soil organic carbon stock, a decrease in soil mineral nitrogen content, a different carabid species composition and a higher spider activity density were found, compared to the adjacent arable parcel. These results indicate a contribution of grass strips to climate regulation, the regulation of water quality, an increase of beta diversity and potential for pest control. Next to hedgerows, crop yield was reduced and winter wheat thousand kernel weight, soil organic carbon stock and spider activity density were increased. These indicators show an effect of the hedgerow on food production, climate regulation and potential for pest control. The study concludes that both grass strips and hedgerows have the potential to increase multiple ecosystem service delivery, but that an increase of every service is not assured and that multifunctionality is affected by management choices. Also, an improved experimental setup in order to enhance ecosystem service monitoring is suggested.;10.1007/s00267-018-1043-4;https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-018-1043-4;;;;;;;;;;x;x;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;reduced crop yield
JMGTQLPD;1995;Kiepe, P.;No Runoff , No Soil Loss : soil and water conservation in hedgerow barrier systems;Land degradation by water erosion represents a serious, and fast increasing, environmental threat. Hedgerow barriers control water erosion through the presence of the tree stem and through an increase in infiltration beneath the hedgerow. The infiltration rate beneath hedgerows is 3-8 times higher than in the alley where crops are grown. Soil water content measurements in hedgerow barrier systems indicate that infiltrated water penetrates the soil beneath hedgerows deeper than the soil beneath the alley and the control. An analytical framework for calculating the impact of hedgerows and mulch on infiltration, runoff and soil loss is presented here. The framework was expanded with algorithms to calculate the impact of hedgerows of various densities, ranging from 1-4 rows. The framework was applied on a seasonal basis and the predictions were satisfactory. Extreme events can be explained when dynamic soil and plant conditions are incorporated. A dynamic simulation model called SHIELD has been developed that explains the experimental observations for runoff, soil loss and crop yields using daily time steps. Application of the model illustrates the importance of dynamic soil and plant conditions to the amount of soil being lost and shows that SHIELD can be used to compute the maximum desired distance between hedgerows with respect to tolerable soil loss. ;;https://edepot.wur.nl/210308;;;;;;;;;;x;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;x;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;

In this study, the possibilities for fodder production from a short rotation coppice of willow (Salix viminalis) used for wood chips to produce energy were investigated. The nutritional value and ensilability were assessed from first year regrowth of willow harvested on 29 June 2011 at Wakelyns Agroforestry, Suffolk, UK. The willow branches with a stem diameter less than 8 mm were manually harvested from 4 plots in two replicates. From 2 plots, another sample was prepared including leaves only. Both dried raw material and silage samples ensiled in evacuated polyethylene bags were analyzed. The crude protein concentration was relatively high in leaf + stem silage (182 g/kg dry matter (DM)) and even higher in leaf only silage (219 g/kg DM) and the fibre concentration was relatively low. However, the organic matter digestibility determined by in vitro pepsin-cellulase method was low (0.421 for leaf + stem silage and 0.511 for leaf only silage) and it cannot be considered as a suitable feed for lactating dairy cows. However, it might be suitable for other animal groups with lower energy requirements. The appearance and smell of the silage samples at opening of the vacuum plastic bags was rather pleasant with minor deteriorations (probably yeasts) visible. The extent of fermentation was low and pH high (5.79) for a rather low DM material (DM concentration 276 g/kg). The water soluble carbohydrates of the raw material (35 g/kg DM) and the residual water soluble carbohydrate concentration in silages was relatively low, which at least partly explains the restricted production of fermentation acids. The fermentation profile was heterofermentative (acetic acid dominated instead of lactic acid). The concentrations of total condensed tannins fractions were almost twice as high in the leaf only silage compared to leaf + stem silage. Although the feed values of willow were low, it may have a role in multifunctional systems, where it can provide additional values in grazing situations such as self-medication and microclimate benefits. For easy and efficient use in animal production, controlled browsing might be used; otherwise methods for harvesting and preservation need to be developed. There seems to be some scope for ensiling willow material. This work is part of an EU FP7 funded project “Sustainable organic and low input dairying” (SOLID, KBBE.2010.1.2-02).

PUUAVHQX;2021;"Temani, Fida; Bouaziz, Ahmed; Daoui, Khalid; Wery, Jacques; Barkaoui, Karim";Olive agroforestry can improve land productivity even under low water availability in the South Mediterranean;Agroforestry systems can be an effective means of stabilizing or even enhancing crop yields under climate change. Although trees compete with crops for soil resources in agroforestry,they can also improve crops' growing conditions, especially, by providing shade under drought. They can promote higher crop yields and higher harvest quality in the drylands. However, the beneficial effect of tree shade may depend on the seasonal pattern of rainfall, which determines the compensation between yield components. In this study, we evaluated two annual crops (durum wheat and faba bean) in olive agroforestry in northern Morocco. We manipulated water supply in a field experiment to span the high inter-annual rainfall variability at the site and tested whether olive trees reduce or improve crop yields. We assessed the effect of water addition on crop growth, yield components, and final yields and estimated the land equivalent ratio of olive agroforestry. Agroforestry limited crop growth and yield whatever the water regime. The magnitude of grain yield reduction was around 50 % for both crops in 2018, probably due to shade. The number of grains per unit area was the most impacted yield component in both 2018 and 2019. In contrast, water addition only had limited effects on faba bean yield, although it enhanced wheat grain yield by 11 % and the number of wheat spikes by 13 %. Agroforestry improved individual grain weight by 39 % for wheat and 17 % for faba bean, and enhanced the protein content of wheat grains and straw by 4 % and 9 %. However, improvements in grain weight and in protein content were not sufficient to compensate for yield loss due to shade. Despite lower crop yields, we show that agroforestry systems are still more land productive than sole crops and trees, even under arid conditions. We show how changing water supply may impact the performance of olive agroforestry in a drier future.;10.1016/j.agee.2020.107234;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2020.107234;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;x;;x;x;;;;x;;;;;;;;x;;;x;;;;;;;;;x;;;;reduced crop yields

Several wildfire prevention programs in southern Europe are currently incorporating extensive livestock grazers in fire prevention activities to reduce the high costs of mechanical clearance. Among these the Andalusian network of grazed fuel breaks, the so-called RAPCA program, stands out for its dimension and stability over time. RAPCA currently works with 220 local shepherds who, with their guided flocks maintain low biomass levels in almost 6000 ha of fuel breaks in public forests to meet fire prevention standards. This work analyses the institutional design and performance of the RAPCA payment scheme under a payment for environmental services (PES) framework. Results show effectiveness of the payment scheme while efficiency is achieved through savings relative to the mainstream mechanized biomass removal, as well as through reduced information asymmetry. High-level and stable political commitment has been crucial for the emergence and consolidation of RAPCA. Moreover, key intermediaries and sound monitoring practices increased levels of trust amongst involved actors. Beneficial side-effects include social recognition of shepherds’ activities and reduction of their friction with forest managers.;10.3390/f9080464;https://doi.org/10.3390/f9080464;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;x;x;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;x;;;;

Agroforestry has been proposed as an effective approach to minimize its effects on crops. However, to design sustainable and productive agroforestry systems, net responses of crops to trees need to be clarified, particularly in regions where competitive interactions will outweigh facilitative ones. The study of plant traits has become a useful approach to select best-adapted plants, yet the sensitivity of yield components to agroforestry and their relationship with plant traits needs investigation. In this experiment, we assess the phenological, morphological and physiological responses of shade-adapted cultivars of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), growing in an agroforestry system (AF) with walnut trees (Juglans x intermedia Mj209xRa), as compared to cereal monocrops (MC). Agroforestry reduced the light intercepted by crops by 58 %, buffered extreme temperatures at the crop canopy level and increased air relative humidity, advancing plant development for wheat and barley. Major tree effects on crops were observed after walnut budburst. Under trees, crops increased the relative water content (RWC), Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) and P content of both wheat and barley leaves, increased Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of barley leaves, and reduced leaf mass area (LMA) in wheat and cell membrane damage in both species. In agroforestry, crops also reduced plant growth, leaf area (LA), leaf area index (LAI) and grain yield in both wheat and barley. Drivers of grain yield differed among agroforestry and open conditions in both species, showing for the first time that the selection of cereal cultivars for specific conditions could be based on plant traits, along with the shade tolerance, to establish successful agroforestry systems.;10.1016/j.agee.2022.108158;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.108158;;;x;;x;x;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;reduced crop yields

Thus, uncertainties connected with its range shift are essential for environmental management. We aimed to predict the future climatic optimum of J. regia in Europe under changing climate, to assess the most important climatic factors that determine its potential distribution, and to compare the results obtained among three different global circulation models (GCMs). We used distribution data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and completed it with data from the literature. Using the MaxEnt algorithm, we prepared a species distribution model for the years 2061–2080 using 19 bioclimatic variables. We applied three emission scenarios, expressed by representative concentration pathways (RCPs): RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 and three GCMs: HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, and MPI-SM-LR. Our study predicted northward shift of the species, with simultaneous distribution loss at the southern edge of the current range, driven by increasing climate seasonality. Temperature seasonality and temperature annual range were the predictors of highest importance. General trends are common for the projections presented, but the variability of our projections among the GCMs or RCPs applied (predicted range will contract from 17.4 to 84.6% of the current distribution area) shows that caution should be maintained while managing J. regia populations. Adaptive measures should focus on maintaining genetic resources and assisted migration at the southern range edge, due to range contraction. Simultaneously, at the northern edge of the range, J. regia turns into an invasive species, which may need risk assessments and control of unintended spread.;10.1007/s10113-020-01745-z;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-020-01745-z;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;;;x;;x;x;x;;;;;x;x;x;;

Apple, cherry, and pear growers in the northeastern USA must control a number of challenging insect pests, including plum curculio Conotrachelus nenuphar (Herbst), codling moth (Cydia pomonella (L.)), and oriental fruit moth Grapholita molesta (Busck). Integrating livestock into tree fruit systems for the purpose of consuming leftover fruit may provide insect and weed pest management services. We rotationally grazed pigs after harvest in certified organic apple, cherry, and pear orchards to determine the amount of fruit the hogs would consume from the orchard floor, the impact hogs would have on orchard ground cover, and what pest insects the hogs could potentially suppress by consuming leftover fruit. The pigs consumed 100 % of leftover fruit in all three orchard types. Pigs significantly increased the amount of bare ground and decreased the amount of grass in all three orchard types. Both codling moth and oriental fruit moth larvae were found to be present in leftover apples and pears collected from the ground, whereas no pest insects were found in leftover cherries. Plum curculio fruit damage was significantly lower in grazed cherry plots, and codling moth/oriental fruit moth fruit damage was significantly lower in grazed pear plots following the first year of the study.

The multifunctional use of trees for energy and wood production, nutrient cycling, carbon storage, biodiversity, landscape quality and – last but not least – fodder makes trees a potential third crop next to grass and maize on farmland including high-output dairy farms. To decide which trees to use for planting, it is important to have insight into the feeding value of the different species. Therefore we created a database on the feeding values, using data from the literature. The database includes records of tree leaves, twigs, and twigs with leaves of 40 different temperate tree species (620 records in total) (www.voederbomen.nl/nutritionalvalues). Using this database, we compared the nutritive value of the leaves of a number of temperate fodder trees. The nutritive values for grass (Lolium perenne L.) are shown for comparison. These data show that, compared to grass, the in vitro organic matter digestibility of tree leaves is relatively low. However, for some species the concentrations of crude protein, and of macro-and micronutrients, are relatively high, which shows the potential value of tree leaves as an additional feed source on dairy farms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;x;;;x;x;;;;;;x;x;x;;

Agroecological infrastructures (AEI) are devoted to the support of ecosystem service providers, although they have mixed effects on natural enemies of crop pests. In temperate regions, alley cropping agroforestry involves within-field AEI, in the form of tree rows and associated understory vegetation strips. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of generalist predators (carabid beetles and cursorial spiders) to control weed seeds and invertebrate pests in alley cropping vs pure crop systems, under two contrasting farming systems (conventional vs organic). Predator surveys were carried out in May and June 2017 in South-Western France over 12 winter cereal fields. Our study revealed that the effect of alley cropping was modulated by the farming system. Under conventional farming, alley cropping had a negative effect on the activity-density and species richness of generalist predators, especially regarding carnivorous carabids whose activity-density was reduced by nearly 50%. Under organic farming, alley cropping enhanced both the activity-density and complementarity of generalist predators, with a two-fold increase in the activity-density of seed-feeding carabids (predominantly granivorous and omnivorous), potentially promoting weed seed and invertebrate pest control. Our results suggest that the effectiveness of AEI in promoting natural enemies depends on the farming system at the field scale, which affects resource availability and determines spillover intensity between habitats. AEI are often perceived as sources of natural enemies. However, sink and retention effects (i.e. reduced or delayed spillover into crop fields due to higher attractiveness of AEI) should not be overlooked as they can explain the mixed impacts of AEI on natural enemy communities.;10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.106041;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.106041;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;
V2ERIR3Q;2013;"Smith, Jo; Pearce, Bruce D.; Wolfe, Martin S.";Reconciling productivity with protection of the environment: Is temperate agroforestry the answer?;Meeting the needs for a growing world population calls for multifunctional land use, which can meet the multiple demands of food and fuel production, environmental and biodiversity protection, and has the capacity for adaptation or resilience to climate change. Agroforestry, a land-use system that integrates trees and shrubs with crops and/or livestock production, has been identified by the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD) as a 'win-win' approach that balances the production of commodities (food, feed, fuel, fiber, etc.) with non-commodity outputs such as environmental protection and cultural and landscape amenities. Evidence is now coming to light that supports the promotion of agroforestry in temperate developed countries as a sustainable alternative to the highly industrialized agricultural model with its associated negative environmental externalities. This paper reviews this evidence within the 'ecosystem services' framework to evaluate agroforestry as part of a multifunctional working landscape in temperate regions. Establishing trees on agricultural land can help to mitigate many of the negative impacts of agriculture, for example by regulating soil, water and air quality, supporting biodiversity, reducing inputs by natural regulation of pests and more efficient nutrient cycling, and by modifying local and global climates. The challenge now lies in promoting the adoption of agroforestry as a mainstream land use through research, dissemination of information and policy changes. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.;10.1017/S1742170511000585;https://doi.org/10.1017/S1742170511000585;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;;;x;x;x;x;x;x;;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;;;;;x;x;x;;

Maize (Zea mays L.) was established between rows of seven-year-old silver maple (Acer saccharinum L.) trees in north-central Missouri, USA with four imposed treatments: (1) an unmodified control with a standard rate of N fertilization (179.2 kg N (as NH4NO3) ha-1), (2) trenching with root barrier installed, (3) supplemental fertilization treatment (standard N + 89.6 kg ha-1 N), and (4) a combination of trenching with root barrier and supplemental fertilization. Whereas soil N status had little effect on maize physiology and yield at the interface, competition for soil water was substantial in both years. Without a root barrier, soil water content, predawn and midday water potential, and midday net photosynthesis of maize plants adjacent to the tree row were reduced compared with those of plants in the alley center, but no differences across the maize crop were evident in the presence of a barrier. Grain yield of border row maize plants lacking an adjacent barrier was depressed compared with that for maize plants with a root barrier present (8.42 vs. 6.59 Mg ha-1 in 1997; 5.38 vs. 3.91 Mg ha-1 in 1998). However, the barrier did not completely restore yield to that in the alley center, suggesting that reductions in light near the tree row also limited production. Top ear height showed a similar pattern of response to the presence of a root barrier. Silver maple trees responded to root barrier installation with reduced annual diameter growth and reduced water status on some sample days.";10.1023/A:1013327510748;https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1013327510748;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;reduced crop yields

These systems could provide a favorable habitat for many organisms, producing shade in summer and litter in autumn, but their impacts on soil macrofauna are poorly studied, with most samplings limited to one date and therefore one season only. This study investigated the seasonal variations in the spatial distribution of soil macrofauna in a Mediterranean alley cropping plot. We sampled three different shading treatments: a strong shading treatment with lightly-pruned trees, a light shading treatment with pollarded trees, and a no-shade treatment without trees in the herbaceous strips. We measured the density of macrofauna individuals classified into different taxonomic and functional groups by the extraction of 25*25*25 cm soil cores in the herbaceous strip (with or without trees), and in the crop alley at 1 m and 2.5 m from the herbaceous strip. We found a similar response of macrofauna density to the distance from the herbaceous strip for all shading treatments. However, this response was strongly dependent on the season. In spring, just after soil tillage, most soil macrofauna presented higher densities in the herbaceous strip than in the crop alley, except for plant feeders. In early summer, this trend was mostly visible for earthworms, Diplopoda and adult Coleoptera. In autumn, higher densities in the herbaceous strip than in the crop alley were only significant for anecic and endogeic earthworms, while other macrofauna categories presented similar densities at all distances from the herbaceous strip, due to an increase in macrofauna density in the crop alley. These large seasonal variations in spatial distribution of soil macrofauna highlight the importance of temporal repetitions when studying community responses to agroforestry system design and management. The mechanisms by which population densities increased in the crop alley a few months after soil perturbation require further investigation.;10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104309;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104309;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;
Y22DAZWU;2019;"Rolo, Victor; Moreno, Gerardo";Shrub encroachment and climate change increase the exposure to drought of Mediterranean wood-pastures;Pastures and wood-pastures, livestock grazing systems where scattered trees and shrubs co-occur, are essential for global food supply. The grazing value of these systems, which is closely related to soil moisture, is increasingly threatened by changes in climate variability and vegetation structure, mainly by shrub encroachment. However, it remains relatively unexplored to what extent the concurrent effect of climate change and shrub encroachment will affect the exposure to drought stress of Mediterranean wood-pastures — defined as a period where soil water availability drops below 40%. Here we combined soil moisture measurements and a process-based water balance model to assess the effect of shrubs, a shallow- and a deep-rooted, on soil moisture under current (2009–2012) and future weather (i.e. RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Soil moisture was measured and predicted in six sites, three for each type of shrub, where two adjacent plots were selected, a control and an encroached plot. During 2009–2012, encroached plots had more extended droughts (29 and 48 days longer in sites encroached with shallow- and deep-rooted shrubs, respectively) and higher usage of deep water (~30%) than control plots. Under future climatic projections, our results show a consistent increase in the duration, an earlier onset of drought and higher reliance on shallow water with time, particularly under the worst climatic scenario. Encroached plots showed higher inter-annual variability than control plots, particularly in plots encroached with the deep-rooted shrub. Our results indicate that the presence of shrubs magnify the effect of climate. This suggests a likely increase in the exposure of Mediterranean wood-pastures to drought if processes of shrub encroachment persist in a context of climatic changes where earlier and more prolonged droughts will become more frequent.;10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.01.029;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.01.029;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;x;;;;
GJ6SPBFY;2020;"Bosi, Cristiam; Pezzopane, José Ricardo M.; Sentelhas, Paulo Cesar";Silvopastoral system with eucalyptus as a strategy for mitigating the effects of climate change on Brazilian pasturelands;The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of Eucalyptus trees in a silvopastoral system on the microclimate and the capacity of that to mitigate the effects of climate change on pasturelands. This study included an open pasture of Piatã palisadegrass and an adjacent pasture that contained both palisadegrass and East-to-West rows of Eucalyptus trees, with 15 m between rows, 2 m between trees within rows. The micrometeorological measurements were collected at several distances from the tree rows and in the open pasture. The silvopastoral system was associated with greater between-row shading when solar declination was high and greater near-tree shading when solar declination was around-22°. Both soil heat flux and temperature were influenced by solar radiation, wind speed, and the ability of tree canopies to reduce radiation losses. Wind speed was consistently lower in the silvopastoral system, owing to the windbreak effect of the Eucalyptus trees. The present study demonstrated that silvopastoral systems can be used to attenuate the effects of climate change, as trees can protect pastureland from intense solar radiation and wind, thereby reducing evapotranspiration and, consequently, improving soil water availability for the understory crop.;10.1590/0001-3765202020180425;https://doi.org/10.1590/0001-3765202020180425;;;x;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;;;;;;;x;x;x;;
LUBUI3AY;2017;"De Stefano, Andrea; Jacobson, Michael G.";Soil carbon sequestration in agroforestry systems: a meta-analysis;Agroforestry systems may play an important role in mitigating climate change, having the ability to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in plant parts and soil. A meta-analysis was carried out to investigate changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks at 0–15, 0–30, 0–60, 0–100, and 0 ≥ 100 cm, after land conversion to agroforestry. Data was collected from 53 published studies. Results revealed a significant decrease in SOC stocks of 26 and 24% in the land-use change from forest to agroforestry at 0–15 and 0–30 cm respectively. The transition from agriculture to agroforestry significantly increased SOC stock of 26, 40, and 34% at 0–15, 0–30, and 0–100 cm respectively. The conversion from pasture/grassland to agroforestry produced significant SOC stock increases at 0–30 cm (9%) and 0–30 cm (10%). Switching from uncultivated/other land-uses to agroforestry increased SOC by 25% at 0–30 cm, while a decrease was observed at 0–60 cm (23%). Among agroforestry systems, significant SOC stocks increases were reported at various soil horizons and depths in the land-use change from agriculture to agrisilviculture and to silvopasture, pasture/grassland to agrosilvopastoral systems, forest to silvopasture, forest plantation to silvopasture, and uncultivated/other to agrisilviculture. On the other hand, significant decreases were observed in the transition from forest to agrisilviculture, agrosilvopastoral and silvopasture systems, and uncultivated/other to silvopasture. Overall, SOC stocks increased when land-use changed from less complex systems, such as agricultural systems. However, heterogeneity, inconsistencies in study design, lack of standardized sampling procedures, failure to report variance estimators, and lack of important explanatory variables, may have influenced the outcomes.;10.1007/s10457-017-0147-9;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-017-0147-9;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;;;;;x;x;x;;

Thus, the objective of this study was to assess if alley cropping with annual crops can contribute to i) mitigate soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, ii) enhance C sequestration in a semiarid Mediterranean irrigated citrus orchard, and iii) increase land productivity. For this, two different treatments were established: i) conventional mandarin monoculture (MC) with no alley cropping; and ii) mandarin diversified with alley cropping of barley/vetch and fava bean (DIV). Measurements of soil CO2 and N2O emissions were periodically performed (every 7–20 days) during two years. Soil CO2 emission rates followed the soil moisture trend, and showed no significant differences between treatments. As an average, soil CO2 emission rates were 147 mg m-2 h-1 in MC and 196 mg m-2 h-1 in DIV. Soil N2O emission rates were not correlated to soil moisture nor temperature, and showed average values of 0.026 mg m-2 h-1 in MC and − 0.002 mg m-2 h-1 in DIV. Alley cropping did not contribute to significantly increase soil organic C and total nitrogen in two years’ time. With regard to production, mandarin yield showed no significant differences between treatments, but alley crops contributed to complementary commodities to the main cash crop, increasing overall land productivity. Thus, alley cropping in irrigated Mediterranean orchards has no significant effect on soil C sequestration and GHG emissions at short-term, with increased land productivity owing to new commodities grown in the alleys. These results confirm that under semiarid Mediterranean climate, long periods are needed to efficiently assess soil C sequestration potential of sustainable practices in orchards.";10.1016/j.eja.2022.126684;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2022.126684;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;x;x;;;;x;x;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;

Nevertheless, the aim of increasing of SOC encounters limitations, e.g. with regards to permanence of carbon storage or leakage effects in food production. Agroforestry systems (AFS) are a promising land use option that is able to sequester substantial amounts of SOC while addressing these challenges. With a focus on temperate climate zones worldwide, available information on SOC in AFS was reviewed to determine their SOC sequestration potential and respective controlling factors. From a total of 61 observations, SOC sequestration rates in soils of AFS were derived for alley cropping systems (n = 25), hedgerows (n = 26) and silvopastoral systems (n = 10). The results showed that AFS have a potential for substantial SOC sequestration in temperate climates. SOC stocks were higher in the topsoil (0–20 cm) than in the control in more than 70% of the observations, and higher within the subsoil (20–40 cm) for 81% of all observations, albeit large variation in the data. The mean SOC sequestration rates were slightly higher at 0–20 cm (0.21 ± 0.79 t ha-1 yr-1) compared to 20–40 cm soil depth (0.15 ± 0.26 t ha-1 yr-1). Hedgerows revealed highest SOC sequestration rates in topsoils and subsoils (0.32 ± 0.26 and 0.28 ± 0.15 t ha-1 yr-1, respectively), followed by alley cropping systems (0.26 ± 1.15 and 0.23 ± 0.25 t ha-1 yr-1) and silvopastoral systems showing a slight mean SOC loss (−0.17 ± 0.50 and −0.03 ± 0.26 t ha-1 yr-1). Moreover, SOC sequestration rates tended to be higher for AFS with broadleaf tree species compared to coniferous species. We conclude that temperate AFS sequester significant amounts of SOC in topsoils and subsoils and represent one of the most promising agricultural measures for climate change mitigation and adaption.;10.1016/j.agee.2021.107689;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2021.107689;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;x;;;x;;;;;;;x;x;x;;

In this context, land-use change has promoted land abandonment and the consequent accumulation of biomass (fuel) in (progressively less managed) forests and (non-forest) natural land, causing higher fire density and severity, economic damage, and land degradation. The expansion of Wildland-Urban Interfaces (WUIs) further affects fire density by negatively impacting peri-urban farming and livestock density. Assuming the role of grazing in controlling fuel accumulation in forests and non-forest natural land as an indirect measure of wildfire containment around large Mediterranean cities, our work focuses on the role of nomadic livestock, i.e., sheep and goats—the most abundant and traditional farm species in the area. The present study (i) investigates the relationship between fire frequency/extent and livestock decline at the regional level in Greece, (ii) explores changes over time in regional wildfire regimes, comparing Attica, a particularly vulnerable peri-urban region which includes Athens (the Greek capital city), with the rest of the country, and (iii) quantifies trends over time in livestock characteristics (population structure and dynamics) over a sufficiently long time interval (1961–2017) at the same spatial scale, with the aim to document the progressive reduction of nomadic livestock in peri-urban districts. A comprehensive analysis of statistical data, corroborated with a literature review, outlined the relationship between livestock decline over time and changes in specific wildfire characteristics at the regional scale, evidencing peculiar environmental conditions in Attica. In this region, a rapid decline of nomadic livestock was observed compared to in the rest of Greece, leading to a higher wildfire risk. The results of this study suggest that nomadic livestock contributes to sustainable management of peri-urban land, stimulating grazing that may prevent fuel accumulation in fringe woodlands.;10.3390/land9010021;https://doi.org/10.3390/land9010021;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;;;;;;;x;;;;

Through increased structural and functional diversity in agricultural landscapes, agroforestry practices can also affect ecosystem services provided by insect pollinators. A literature review was conducted to synthesize information on how temperate agroforestry systems influence insect pollinators and their pollination services with particular focus on the role of trees and shrubs. Our review indicates that agroforestry practices can provide three overarching benefits for pollinators: (1) providing habitat including foraging resources and nesting or egg-laying sites, (2) enhancing site and landscape connectivity, and (3) mitigating pesticide exposure. In some cases, agroforestry practices may contribute to unintended consequences such as becoming a sink for pollinators, where they may have increased exposure to pesticide residue that can accumulate in agroforestry practices. Although there is some scientific evidence suggesting that agroforestry practices can enhance crop pollination and yield, more research needs to be conducted on a variety of crops to verify this ecosystem service. Through a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of agroforestry practices on pollinators and their key services, we can better design agroforestry systems to provide these benefits in addition to other desired ecosystem services.;10.3390/f10110981;https://doi.org/10.3390/f10110981;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;;;;;x;x;x;;
SXF5Q4P3;2020;"Varah, Alexa; Jones, Hannah; Smith, Jo; Potts, Simon G.";Temperate agroforestry systems provide greater pollination service than monoculture;Insect pollination is a globally important ecosystem service, contributing to crop yields, production stability and the maintenance of wild plant populations. Ironically, agriculture is one of the major global drivers of wild insect pollinator decline. At the same time, increasing human population is driving ever greater demands on crop production. Agroforestry (AF) – a more diverse farming system integrating woody and agricultural crops – can theoretically reconcile high production with provision of ecosystem services such as pollination. However, empirical studies of pollination in temperate AF systems are almost entirely lacking. We sought to fill this knowledge gap by assessing whether AF can provide increased pollination service compared to monoculture (MC) systems. Six UK sites, each containing an AF and a MC system, were studied over three years. Wild pollinator abundance and diversity were used as proxies for the magnitude and stability, respectively, of the pollinating community. We also directly measured pollination service as seed set in a wild plant phytometer. We found that temperate AF systems can provide greater pollination service than MC: AF treatments had twice as many solitary bees and hoverflies, and in arable systems 2.4 times more bumblebees, than MC treatments. AF also had 4.5 times more seed set compared to MC in one of the two years. At 40% of site-by-year sampling units, species richness of solitary bees was on average 10.5 times higher in AF treatments. This provides evidence in favour of the expectation that AF systems can support higher pollinator richness, and therefore greater potential stability, of pollination service. For the other sampling units, and for bumblebees (Bombus spp.), there was no treatment effect on species richness. Further work is needed to investigate the effect of AF on species richness and its mechanistic basis. Our results also highlight the importance of AF system design, ensuring that ecosystem services outcomes are explicitly planned at the design stage. We suggest that AF has a role to play in improving the sustainability of modern farming and in mitigating the ongoing loss of wild pollinating insects, which is strongly driven by prevailing agricultural practices.;10.1016/j.agee.2020.107031;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2020.107031;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;x;x;x;;;;;x;x;x;;

Recent studies show that growth of mixed stands may be more resilient to drought than pure stands. The two most economically important and widely distributed tree species in Europe are Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), but little is known about their susceptibility to drought when coexist. This paper analyses the resilience (resistance, recovery rate and recovery time) at individual-tree level using a network of tree-ring collections from 22 sites along a climatic gradient from central Europe to Scandinavia. We aimed to identify differences in growth following drought between the two species and between mixed and pure stands, and how environmental variables (climate, topography and site location) and tree characteristics influence them. We found that both the timing and duration of drought drive the different responses between species and compositions. Norway spruce showed higher vulnerability to summer drought, with both lower resistance and a longer recovery time than Scots pine. Mixtures provided higher drought resistance for both species compared to pure stands, but the benefit decreases with the duration of the drought. Especially climate sensitive and old trees in climatically marginal sites were more affected by drought stress. Synthesis. Promoting Scots pine and mixed forests is a promising strategy for adapting European forests to climate change. However, if future droughts become longer, the advantage of mixed stands could disappear which would be especially negative for Norway spruce.;10.1111/1365-2745.13978;https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.13978;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;x;;;x;;;;;;;;;x;x;;

We explored a more wholistic, long-term approach based on priority maps for the implementation of diverse management options aimed at creating fire resilient landscapes, restoring cultural fire regimes, facilitating safe and efficient fire response, and creating fire-adapted communities. To illustrate this new comprehensive strategy for fire-prone Mediterranean areas, we developed and implemented the framework in Catalonia (northeastern Spain). We first used advanced simulation modeling methods to assess various wildfire exposure metrics across spatially changing fire-regime conditions, and these outputs were then combined with land use maps and historical fire occurrence data to prioritize different fuel and fire management options at the municipality level. Priority sites for fuel management programs concentrated in the central and northeastern high-hazard forestlands. The suitable areas for reintroducing fires in natural ecosystems located in scattered municipalities with ample lightning ignitions and minimal human presence. Priority areas for ignition prevention programs were mapped to populated coastal municipalities and main transportation corridors. Landscapes where fire suppression is the principal long-term strategy concentrated in agricultural plains with a high density of ignitions. Localized programs to build defensible space and improve self-protection on communities could be emphasized in the coastal wildland-urban interface and inner intermix areas from Barcelona and Gerona. We discuss how the results of this study can facilitate collaborative landscape planning and identify the constraints that prevent a longer term and more effective solution to better coexist with fire in southern European regions.;10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.10.027;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.10.027;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;x;;;;

Panama’s Azuero Peninsula experiences a five-month dry season that results in substantial losses in grass productivity. We studied three cultivars of Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus cv. Massai, cv. Mombaza, and cv. Tanzania) under open (O), moderate (M), and dense (D) tree canopies. We hypothesized that changes in soil properties, herbage mass, and nutritive value would be optimized in M in agreement with the stress gradient hypothesis, which predicts an increase in facilitation with increasing environmental stress. Results after two years showed few changes in soil chemical properties, but bulk density decreased with increasing tree cover. Annually, O produced more herbage mass than M and D and Massai produced more herbage mass than Mombaza, but not compared to Tanzania. Nutritive value improved under tree cover, with D and M showing higher relative feed values than O. Massai demonstrated the greatest tolerance to drought in M, producing more herbage mass in February when compared to D and O. Results partially support the hypothesis, suggesting that herbage mass is greatest in M for Massai during the dry season, but greatest in O over the year. The observed productivity under moderate tree densities could result in improved animal welfare between the months of December and May, the critical dry period for this region.;10.1007/s10457-021-00628-4;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-021-00628-4;;;;;;;x;;;;;;x;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;x;x;x;;

H.";Tree effects on forage growth and soil water in an Appalachian silvopasture;Silvopastures may have the potential to increase forage yields beneath trees compared to open pasture at some sites. This has been attributed to a combination of factors including improved water use efficiency by shaded grass and increased water availability through hydraulic lift by trees. The objectives of this research were to determine if silvopastures changed forage mass production and available soil water, and to determine how these two factors were related. Forage mass and soil water were sampled at 1.0, 2.0, and 3.6 m from the tree stem, or plot center under honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos L.), black walnut (Juglans nigra L.) and shade cloth in 2006 and 2007. Soil water was measured in the top 10 cm of soil using a capacitance probe, and at 30-cm intervals, from 45 to 105 cm, using a neutron probe. Forage was collected to determine dry mass and annual yield. In 2006, forage mass was greater under black walnuts and honey locusts than under 70% shade cloth. In 2007, with a 50% shade cloth, forage growth was similar in all treatments. In both 2006 and 2007, soil moisture in the top 10 cm was higher under shade cloth compared to honey locust or black walnut trees. Similarities in forage mass between treatments in 2007 indicate that the differences in soil water were not biologically significant for forage growth. Lower forage mass under the 70% shade cloth in 2006 was due to suppressed growth from intense shading. The major implication for pasture managers is that trees in these pastures had no negative effect on soil water availability and forage growth.;10.1007/s10457-011-9376-5;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-011-9376-5;;;;;;x;x;;;x;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;;;;;;;x;x;x;;

In the grazed fuelbreak network in Andalusia (Spain), over 2000 ha of fuelbreaks were characterized and grazing in them was evaluated in 2008 and 2009. The grazing evaluation was based on several visual assessments of the utilization rate of vegetation by livestock and the general grazing level observed. These parameters were employed to classify fuelbreaks into four levels of accomplishment of the grazing objectives, both through individual assessments (2008) and with the aid of an automatic procedure based on discriminant analysis (2009). The accuracy of the automatic classification functions for 2009 reached 86%. This value remained high (82%) when only the parameter with the most discriminatory power (the mean general grazing level) and predefined thresholds were employed. Based on these results, a streamlined monitoring system is proposed to evaluate grazing in fuelbreaks. Regarding fuelbreak characteristics, larger shrub volumes were found to negatively affect the accomplishment of grazing objectives. For fuelbreak surface area, distance to animal shelter and mean steepness, the data were non-conclusive. Both goat and sheep flocks demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing fuel loads.;10.1016/j.agee.2011.02.002;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2011.02.002;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;x;;;;
T83YED4L;2023;"Hugenschmidt, Johannes; Kay, Sonja";Unmasking adaption of tree root structure in agroforestry Systems in Switzerland using GPR;The interest in agroforestry systems has increased considerably in recent years. The systems are more resilient to climate change and offer advantages related to soil health and biodiversity. Although the aboveground impacts of agroforestry systems are well known, the knowledge concerning root growth of trees remains limited. This study tested the applicability of a non-destructive investigation method, the ground penetrating radar (GPR), to detect tree roots. We mapped two 80-year-old pear trees in cropland and investigated the impact of tilled and no-tilled management on the root system architecture especially in deeper soils (>0.6 m). The root mapping method was successful, we determined the main roots of the tree up to a depth of 0.75 m. In addition, we found tillage significantly impacted root distribution. Tillage removed tree roots almost completely to a depth of 0.4 m. The bulk of the roots was present at a depth of 0.6 to 0.75 m (83% of the roots) in the tilled section, while it was found at 0.3 to 0.55 m (74%) in the no-tilled section. Detected roots indicated an overcompensation by additional roots in the tilled section that were not formed without tillage. Overall, we found agroforestry trees were rooting deeper, below the managed cropland and therefore colonise different soil layers. Thus, the potential volume of water and nutrient intake was enlarged, which might enhance the resilience of the combined production systems. In addition, our approach presents a method for future non-destructive and continuous monitoring of tree roots and their development.;10.1016/j.geodrs.2023.e00659;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geodrs.2023.e00659;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;x;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;

Using and creating microclimates is a recommended climate adaptation strategy that needs research. Our hypothesis is that planting Q. suber in north-facing slopes and water lines results in a higher survival rate than those that are planted in ridges and south-facing slopes. Secondly, our hypothesis is that existing shrubs (in this case, Cistus ladanifer) can be used to create microclimatic sheltering and increase the survival of Q. suber plantations. In experiment 1, we tested the survival of Q. suber plantations in four different topographic conditions. For that, 80 Q. suber plants were planted over four different topographic conditions, where soil probes were installed to monitor soil moisture and temperature. Two years after, the results show an increased survival rate in the north-facing slope and water line when compared to the ridge area (p = 0.032). In experiment 2, we tested if planting in the shade of rows of C. ladanifer increases the survival rate of Q. suber plantations. For that, 1200 Q. suber plants were planted; 600 in a Montado open area with no shade and 600 under the shade of rows of C. ladanifer shrubs. A total of 17 months after plantation, there was a significantly higher survival rate of the shaded plants (p = 0.027).

EITWK7FN;2013;"Aertsens, Joris; De Nocker, Leo; Gobin, Anne";Valuing the carbon sequestration potential for European agriculture; This paper aims at indicating the potential of agricultural measures in sequestering carbon as an option for climate change mitigation. The related value for society is estimated. Principle results: Agricultural practices like agroforestry, introducing hedges, low and no tillage and cover crops have an important potential to increase carbon sequestration. The total technical potential in the EU-27 is estimated to be 1566milliontonnesCO2-equivalent per year. This corresponds to 37% of all CO2-equivalent emissions in the EU in 2007. The introduction of agroforestry is the measure with the highest potential, i.e. 90% of the total potential of the measures studied. Taking account only of the value for climate change mitigation, the introduction of agroforestry is estimated to have a value of 282euro/ha in 2012 that will gradually increase to 1007euro/ha in 2030. Major conclusions: This implies that there is a huge potential which represents an important value for society in general and for the agricultural sector in specific. At the European level, only in the last few years policy makers have recognized the important benefits of agroforestry. In their rural development programmes some European countries now support farmers to introduce agroforestry. But still the current level of support is only a small fraction of the societal value of agroforestry. If this value would be fully recognized by internalizing the positive externality, we expect that agroforestry will be introduced to a very large extent in the next decades, in Europe and the rest of the world, and this will importantly change the rural landscapes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.;10.1016/j.landusepol.2012.09.003;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2012.09.003;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;;;;;x;x;x;;carbon sequestration
3ECT5BUQ;2020;"Bayala, J.; Prieto, I.";Water acquisition, sharing and redistribution by roots: applications to agroforestry systems;Aims: In the face of problems caused by ‘intensive agriculture’ dominated by large areas of monocultures, mixed intercropping mimicking natural ecosystems has been reported to constitute a viable solution to increase and stabilize productivity. When designing such systems, root niche separation was thought to be a prerequisite to optimize production. Methods: This paper reviews the beneficial and adverse effects of trees and crops on water acquisition and redistribution in agroforestry ecosystems using the concepts of competition and facilitation between plants in link with root functional traits. Results: The results of the review showed that the reality was more complex leading agroforestry practitioners to adopt management practices to induce a separation in root activities thus avoid competition, particularly for water. Water uptake by plant roots is triggered by the water potential difference between the soil and the atmosphere when leaf stomata are open and depends largely on the root exploration capacity of the plant. Thus, root water uptake dynamics are strongly related to root-length densities and root surface areas. In addition, plants with deep roots are able to lift up or redistribute water to the upper layers through a process known as hydraulic lift, potentially acting as “bioirrigators” to adjacent plants. The redistributed water could be of importance not only in regulating plant water status, e.g. by enhancing transpiration, but also in increasing the survival and growth of associated crops in mixed systems. Conclusions: Even though some more work is still needed to assess the volume of water transferred to neighbors, hydraulic lift could constitute an ecological viable mechanism to buffer against droughts and ensure productivity in regions with erratic rainfall. Giving the difficulty in measuring the above-mentioned aspects in the field, modeling of some of the most relevant parameters to quantify them might inform the design of future empirical studies.;10.1007/s11104-019-04173-z;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11104-019-04173-z;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;;;;;x;x;x;;

BEGP8FYW;2000;"Droppelmann, K. J.; Lehmann, J.; Ephrath, J. E.; Berliner, P. R.";Water use efficiency and uptake patterns in a runoff agroforestry system in an arid environment;Water is the most limiting factor for plant production in arid to semiarid regions. In order to overcome this limitation surface runoff water can be used to supplement seasonal rainfall. During 1996 we conducted a runoff irrigated agroforestry field trial in the Turkana district of Northern Kenya. The effects of two different Acacia saligna (Labill.) H. Wendl. tree planting densities (2500 and 833 trees per ha), tree pruning (no pruning vs. pruning) and annual intercrops (no intercrop vs. intercrop: Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench during the first season and Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. during the second season) on water use were investigated. The annual crops were also grown as monocrops. Water consumption ranged from 585 to 840 mm during the first season (only treatments including trees). During the second season, which was shorter and the plants relied solely on stored water in the soil profile, water consumption was less than half of that during the first season. Highest water consumptions were found for non-pruned trees at high density and the lowest were found for the annual crops grown as monocrops. Tree pruning decreased water uptake compared to non-pruned trees but soil moisture depletion pattern showed complementarity in water uptake between pruned trees and annual intercrops. The highest values of water use efficiency for an individual treatment were achieved when the pruned trees at high density were intercropped with sorghum (1.59 kg m-3) and cowpea (1.21 kg m-3). Intercropping and high tree density increased water use efficiency in our runoff agro-forestry trial. We ascribe the observed improvement in water use efficiency to the reduction of unproductive water loss from the bare soil.;10.1023/A:1006352623333;https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1006352623333;;;;;;;x;;;x;x;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

Lourdes; Moreno, Gerardo";Winter cereal production in a Mediterranean silvoarable walnut system in the face of climate change;One of the foreseeable consequences of climate change is a reduction in crop yields. In recent years, agroforestry systems have been identified as a strategy for climate change mitigation and adaptation. In this study we assess the potential of a silvoarable system to protect crops against extreme climate events. We studied a 9-year-old hybrid walnut silvoarable system (Juglans x intermedia Mj209xRa) intercropped with cultivars of two winter cereals – wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) – for three consecutive years and compared it with monocrops and pure tree plantations. The parameters studied were grain and total biomass yield, harvest index, grain size and tree diameter increment. Plant phenology and soil and plant nutrients were also examined. Climate conditions and tree presence conditioned cereal yields, and the responses to silvoarable conditions differed among cereal species and cultivars. The silvoarable system with barley had higher production than monocrops in years with early heat events (yield increment of 55% in the first year and 15% in the second year). For wheat, no positive effect of trees in the silvoarable system was found, although grain quality improved significantly (2.56% and 2.76% N grain content in monocrops and silvoarable systems, respectively). Tree growth, measured as diameter at breast height increment, was lower in the silvoarable system (2.06 cm at the end of the study) than in the monospecific plantation (2.83 cm in the same period). The land equivalent ratio was always higher than 1 (1.34–2.08), showing that the silvoarable system was more productive than sole pure plantations and cereal monocrops.;10.1016/j.agee.2018.05.024;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.05.024;;;;;;x;x;;;;;;;;;x;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;
4PKH7MGL;2019;"Guillot, Esther; Hinsinger, Philippe; Dufour, Lydie; Roy, Jacques; Bertrand, Isabelle";With or without trees: Resistance and resilience of soil microbial communities to drought and heat stress in a Mediterranean agroforestry system;Soil microbial communities in Mediterranean agroecosystems experience long drought periods that are typically combined with heat and frequently interspersed with rapid rewetting events. Agroforestry systems are of growing interest and viewed as possible alternative to conventional cropping systems in the context of climate change. Our aim was to evaluate the resistance and resilience of soil microbial communities against drought with or without heat stress at different distances from the tree row in an agroforestry system as compared to a conventional cropping system. Soils were sampled at several distances from the tree row in a 21-year-old walnut agroforestry system and a contiguous conventional crop in Southern France. We simulated two cycles of drying-rewetting under controlled conditions and applied three distinct treatments: control (without stress), drought and drought combined with heat stress. We monitored microbial respiration over the incubation period. The inorganic N and microbial biomass C, N and P contents (MBC, MBN and MBP) were assessed during the drying period (resistance), just after rewetting and at the end of the experiment (resilience), while bacterial and fungal abundances were measured at the end of the resistance period. We demonstrated that an agroforestry system can induce spatial heterogeneity in soil microbial biomass and functions under control conditions. Microbial biomass and activity, soil organic matter (SOM) and mineral N levels increased on the tree row. This spatial heterogeneity pattern was preserved for soil microbial response to drought combined or not with heat. Microorganisms sampled in the middle of the interrow or in the conventional crop exhibited highest biomass resistance and lowest resilience when facing combined drought and heat stress. Soil microbial biomass resistance and resilience were similar whatever the spatial position when microorganisms had to deal with drought stress only. Our findings suggested that despite higher SOM content, microbial biomass and activity at and near the tree row, the legacy effect of the tree row did not lead to higher ecological stability under stressful climatic conditions. We also demonstrated that soil microorganisms can considerably change their stoichiometry depending on the stress treatment. Soil microorganisms showed elevated MBC:MBN, MBC:MBP and variable MBN:MBP during the resistance period. A high stoichiometric flexibility of microorganisms was observed when exposed to drought stress only, while stoichiometric changes were irreversible when exposed to combined drought and heat stress.;10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.11.011;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.11.011;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;
XFCVRSJI;2023;"Amassaghrou, Asmae; Barkaoui, Karim; Bouaziz, Ahmed; Alaoui, Si Bennasseur; Fatemi, Zain El Abidine; Daoui, Khalid";Yield and related traits of three legume crops grown in olive-based agroforestry under an intense drought in the South Mediterranean;Heat and drought stresses have become more frequent and intense in the Mediterranean, strongly influencing arable crop phenology, growth, and grain yield. Agroforestry systems can effectively buffer the adverse climate conditions and stabilize or even increase crop yield under climate change. However, the positive effects of agroforestry remain uncertain due to the possible intense competition between trees and crops, especially for legume crops that have been less studied than cereals in such context. This study aimed to assess the response of the phenology, growth, grain yield, and yield-related traits of chickpea (Cicer arietinum), faba bean (Vicia faba), and lentil (Lens culinaris) to olive-based agroforestry (AFS) as compared to sole crops system (SCS) in the South of the Mediterranean. We conducted a field experiment during two growing seasons marked by an intense drought, either at the beginning (year 1) or at the end (year 2) of the crop cycle. Crop growth and yield were lower in year 1 than in year 2, reflecting the adverse growing conditions caused by the early drought. They were also lower in AFS than in SCS for both years, indicating that trees had competitive effects on crops. In year 1, the yield loss of grains in AFS was 66 % for lentil, 47 % for chickpea, and 43 % for faba bean compared to SCS, confirming the greater shade sensitivity of lentil. In year 2, the reduction was significantly smaller and was about 46 %, 34 %, 38 % for lentil, chickpea and, faba bean, respectively. The number of pods and grains were the most affected yield components by agroforestry and drought timing across the three legumes crops. Similar responses were found when comparing crops at different distances to trees within the AFS field. Crops generally had lower biomass and yield, explained by fewer pods and grains, on the northern side of trees compared to the southern side of trees or the middle of tree inter-rows, causing significant spatial heterogeneity in crops. However, lentil and chickpea had a positive response to shade during the early drought year while a negative response during the late drought year, suggesting that the benefits of the microclimate created by olive trees express depending on drought timing and crop physiology. Our study supports legume integration into AFS, suggesting that chickpea should be considered during high-stress conditions, while faba bean should be preferred during low-stress conditions.;10.1016/j.sjbs.2023.103597;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2023.103597;;;;;;x;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;x;;;;;;;;;x;;;;reduced crop yields
ZHL6NEH3;2012;"Ryschawy, J.; Choisis, N.; Choisis, J.P.; Joannon, A.; Gibon, A.";Mixed crop-livestock systems: an economic and environmental-friendly way of farming?;Intensification and specialisation of agriculture in developed countries enabled productivity to be improved but had detrimental impacts on the environment and threatened the economic viability of a huge number of farms. The combination of livestock and crops, which was very common in the past, is assumed to be a viable alternative to specialised livestock or cropping systems. Mixed crop-livestock systems can improve nutrient cycling while reducing chemical inputs and generate economies of scope at farm level. Most assumptions underlying these views are based on theoretical and experimental evidence. Very few assessments of their environmental and economic advantages have nevertheless been undertaken in real-world farming conditions. In this paper, we present a comparative assessment of the environmental and economic performances of mixed crop-livestock farms v. specialised farms among the farm population of the French ‘Coteaux de Gascogne’. In this hilly region, half of the farms currently use a mixed crop-livestock system including beef cattle and cash crops, the remaining farms being specialised in either crops or cattle. Data were collected through an exhaustive survey of farms located in our study area. The economic performances of farming systems were assessed on 48 farms on the basis of (i) overall gross margin, (ii) production costs and (iii) analysis of the sensitivity of gross margins to fluctuations in the price of inputs and outputs. The environmental dimension was analysed through (i) characterisation of farmers’ crop management practices, (ii) analysis of farm land use diversity and (iii) nitrogen farm-gate balance. Local mixed crop-livestock farms did not have significantly higher overall gross margins than specialised farms but were less sensitive than dairy and crop farms to fluctuations in the price of inputs and outputs considered. Mixed crop-livestock farms had lower costs than crop farms, while beef farms had the lowest costs as they are grass-based systems. Concerning crop management practices, our results revealed an intensification gradient from low to high input farming systems. Beyond some general trends, a wide range of management practices and levels of intensification were observed among farms with a similar production system. Mixed crop-livestock farms were very heterogeneous with respect to the use of inputs. Nevertheless, our study revealed a lower potential for nitrogen pollution in mixed crop-livestock and beef production systems than in dairy and crop farming systems. Even if a wide variability exists within system, mixed crop-livestock systems appear to be a way for an environmental and economical sustainable agriculture.;10.1017/S1751731112000675;https://doi.org/10.1017/S1751731112000675;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;;;;x;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;x;;;;;

The fires indicate effects of climate change and expose consequences of rural demographic changes, deficits in regional and touristic development planning and shortcomings in forest policy. This forum article highlights the dimensions of the problem, calls for a paradigm shift and shows solutions. Land abandonment, woody plant encroachment and non-reflective afforestation are leading to increasing amounts of combustible biomass. To prevent disastrous fires in future, fundamental changes in tree species composition, forest structure and management are essential. Plantations of reseeding pines are to be substituted by spacious or periodically open woodlands of long-lived trees with resprouting capacity such as Mediterranean oaks. Biomass-reducing practices including wood-pasture have to be revived in rural and peri-urban areas. Exemplary fire-resistant multifunctional oak woodlands occur throughout the Mediterranean. Urgent and medium-term measures in the burnt areas include promoting natural ecosystem regeneration, developing regionalized seed banks and nurseries to support native genetic resources, fostering vegetation mosaics of groves and multiple-use open and coppice woodland maintained by traditional practices, and in general forest management aiming at fuel biomass reduction and a policy counteracting land abandonment.;10.3897/pls2021582/04;https://doi.org/10.3897/pls2021582/04;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;;;;;;;x;;;;

N";Assessing food sustainable intensification potential of agroforestry using a carbon balance method;Food security, climate change mitigation, and land use challenges are interlinked and need to be considered simultaneously. One possible solution is sustainable intensification, which is the practice of increasing food production per area of land whilst also reducing the environmental impacts associated with this. Agroforestry has been stated to be a practice that meets this definition. In this study, a new methodology is presented to assess the potential of different management options as sustainable intensification practices. The methodology is based on comparing the carbon emissions associated with the production of food and the carbon sequestered for that same activity for a particular quantity of food produced over a specific area and over a specific time. The resulting indicator, the “carbon balance” is the difference between the greenhouse gasses emitted (considered as negative values) and carbon sequestered (positive values) estimated in Mg CO 2eq per Mg of food produced on one hectare of land for one year. The carbon balance quantifies the global warming potential associated with sustainable intensification by integrating a process-based model with life cycle analysis and is able to estimate above-and below-ground biomass and soil carbon content. This methodology is tested in Portugal for wheat production under crop monoculture and agroforestry systems. The results show agroforestry to be a suitable practice for sustainable intensification compared to a crop monoculture as it just slightly decreased wheat yields whilst providing a positive carbon balance from year 50 onwards of approximately 1 Mg of CO 2eq sequestered per Mg of wheat produced.;10.3832/ifor2578-011;https://doi.org/10.3832/ifor2578-011;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;;;x;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;

The effects of intercropping on aboveground yield and land equivalent ratio (LER) were also determined. The experiment was conducted at Hetian in the southern part of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The results showed that walnut/wheat intercropping reduced the aboveground yield of both component species. However, the LER of the intercropping system averaged 1.62. This meant that intercropping increased land use efficiency. Intercropping signifi- cantly reduced the root length density, root surface area density, and root diameter (RD) of both compo- nent species compared with sole-cropping. In contrast, intercropping significantly increased the specific root length of walnut. Root competition between species was the greatest in the 0–40 cm soil depth. Root competition caused uneven distribution of RD and specific root length. The plasticity of root morphology and spatial distribution is key for adapting to compe- tition and maximizing water and nutrient uptake in walnut/wheat agroforestry systems.;10.1007/s10457-017-0133-2;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-017-0133-2;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;x;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;

Caitlin; Cadaret, Caitlin N.; Bigler, Elizabeth J.; Engle, Terry E.; Wagner, John J.; Clark, Daniel L.";Impacts of shade on cattle well-being in the beef supply chain;Shade is a mechanism to reduce heat load providing cattle with an environment supportive of their welfare needs. Although heat stress has been extensively reviewed, researched, and addressed in dairy production systems, it has not been investigated in the same manner in the beef cattle supply chain. Like all animals, beef cattle are susceptible to heat stress if they are unable to dissipate heat during times of elevated ambient temperatures. There are many factors that impact heat stress susceptibility in beef cattle throughout the different supply chain sectors, many of which relate to the production system, that is, availability of shade, microclimate of environment, and nutrition management. The results from studies evaluating the effects of shade on production and welfare are difficult to compare due to variation in structural design, construction materials used, height, shape, and area of shade provided. Additionally, depending on operation location, shade m or may not be beneficial during all times of the year, which can influence the decision to make shade a permanent part of management systems. Shade has been shown to lessen the physiologic response of cattle to heat stress. Shaded cattle exhibit lower respiration rates, body temperatures, and panting scores compared with unshaded cattle in weather that increases the risk of heat stress. Results from studies investigating the provision of shade indicate that cattle seek shade in hot weather. The impact of shade on behavioral patterns is inconsistent in the current body of research, with some studies indicating that shade provision impacts behavior and other studies reporting no difference between shaded and unshaded groups. Analysis of performance and carcass characteristics across feedlot studies demonstrated that shaded cattle had increased ADG, improved feed efficiency, HCW, and dressing percentage when compared with cattle without shade. Despite the documented benefits of shade, current industry statistics, although severely limited in scope, indicate low shade implementation rates in feedlots and data in other supply chain sectors do not exist. Industry guidelines and third-party on-farm certification programs articulate the critical need for protection from extreme weather but are not consistent in providing specific recommendations and requirements. Future efforts should include: updated economic analyses of cost vs. benefit of shade implementation, exploration of producer perspectives and needs relative to shade, consideration of shade impacts in the cow-calf and slaughter plant segments of the supply chain, and integration of indicators of affective (mental) state and preference in research studies to enhance the holistic assessment of cattle welfare.;10.1093/jas/skaa375;https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/skaa375;;;;;;x;x;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;x;;;;;x;x;x;;

To reconcile these diverse management needs, we introduce a systematic framework for ‘integrated pest and pollinator management’ (IPPM). We also highlight novel tools to unify monitoring and economic decision making processes for IPPM, and outline key policy actions and knowledge gaps. We propose that IPPM is needed to promote more coordinated ecosystem-based strategies for sustainable food production, against the backdrop of increasing pesticide regulation and pollinator dependency in agriculture.;10.1016/j.tplants.2020.01.006;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2020.01.006;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;x;;

This constrains humanity’s ability to protect our planet’s climate and life-sustaining functions. The substantial body of research we review reveals that forest, water and energy interactions provide the foundations for carbon storage, for cooling terrestrial surfaces and for distributing water resources. Forests and trees must be recognized as prime regulators within the water, energy and carbon cycles. If these functions are ignored, planners will be unable to assess, adapt to or mitigate the impacts of changing land cover and climate. Our call to action targets a reversal of paradigms, from a carbon-centric model to one that treats the hydrologic and climate-cooling effects of trees and forests as the first order of priority. For reasons of sustainability, carbon storage must remain a secondary, though valuable, by-product. The effects of tree cover on climate at local, regional and continental scales offer benefits that demand wider recognition. The forest- and tree-centered research insights we review and analyze provide a knowledge-base for improving plans, policies and actions. Our understanding of how trees and forests influence water, energy and carbon cycles has important implications, both for the structure of planning, management and governance institutions, as well as for how trees and forests might be used to improve sustainability, adaptation and mitigation efforts;10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2017.01.002;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2017.01.002;;;x;x;;x;x;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;;x;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;
P6ANVYC5;2024;"Favor, Katherine; Gold, Michael; Halsey, Samniqueka; Hall, Megan; Vallone, Rosana";Agroforestry for enhanced arthropod pest management in Vineyards;Modern vineyards, characterized by monoculture and landscape simplicity, face a multi- tude of pest management issues, including heightened pest and disease pressure, reliance on agrochemicals, threats of pesticide resistance, and vulnerability due to climate change. Incorporating trees into and around vineyards through agroforestry practices such as alley cropping, windbreaks, hedgerows, and multi-story cropping has the potential to create diversified vine- yard landscapes that could reduce pest and disease pressure, decrease the use of pesticides, and increase economic stability. This review summarizes the exist- ing knowledge on arthropod pest management in het- erogeneous woody vineyard landscapes and provides a foundation upon which future research on vineyard agroforestry systems can be built. Existing literature suggests that vineyards with adjacent and incorpo- rated trees can reduce arthropod pest damage by increasing the abundance of predaceous insects and bats, which has been shown to increase parasitism and predation rates. These types of diversified vine- yard landscapes may also control some viral and bac- terial infections by controlling the insect vectors that transmit these pathogens, although certain trees can serve as alternative hosts for some viral vectors. Con- trol of arthropods in vineyards also has the potential to be increased by the presence of trees because of the windbreak effect that trees provide, which allows for efficient and timely applications of pesticides at the precise moment when pest pressure is at the proper threshold. Because of the demonstrated benefits of trees in and around vineyards on arthropod insect and mite control, as summarized in this paper, intention- ally incorporating trees into vineyard designs in the form of vineyard agroforestry systems could be a component of an effective arthropod integrated pest management strategy, and is a subject that warrants further research.;10.1007/s10457-023-00900-9;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-023-00900-9;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;x;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;;

In general, we found that shade utilization and most of the predominating orientations and behaviors differed significantly (P < 0.05) by both time of day (Hour) and BGT in direct sunlight (BGTsun), while interactions between these two effects (Hour × BGTsun) were often nonsignificant. The mean percentage of the herd using shade was highest in mid-morning (87–96%) and early afternoon (97%), but also increased with BGTsun regardless of the time of day; these trends were similar for both dark- and light-colored cattle. Lying down was the dominant behavior exhibited in the shade, while foraging was the most prevalent behavior in the sun. When herd shade usage was lowest in mid- to late-afternoon (<1%) we also observed an increase in the use of heat-mitigating orientations in the sun (37–47%). We discuss some practical implications of these results, including the potential use of temperature thresholds to interpret cattle behaviors and shade usage.";10.1007/s00484-017-1429-7;https://doi.org/10.1007/s00484-017-1429-7;;;;;;x;x;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x;x;x;;;;;x;x;x;;
94AGYETP;2010;Gahukar, R T;Bioefficacy of indigenous plant products against pests and diseases of Indian forest trees: A review;This review discusses the bioefficacy of natural products (de- rived from neem and other tropical trees) which have been used against insect pests and diseases attacking forest trees in India. These products are effective, cheaper and eco-friendly and act as antifeedant, repellent, sterility inducing, toxic or regulate insect growth. Integration of these products in forest pest management strategies would enhance the sus- tainability of forests and prevent the deterioration of wood quality.;10.1007/s11676-010-0038-7;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11676-010-0038-7;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;ppps from trees;
89JSYRUA;2008;Gea-Izquierdo, G;Modelos silvopascícolas en sistemas adehesados del oeste de la península ibérica;The holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) dehesa from the West Iberian Peninsula is a manmade agrosilvopastroal system. Despite its high ecological and economical importance, there are still many unsolved questions in the ecosystem. Today, the society demands sustainability in natural resources management, and to achieve sustainable management it is necessary to fully understand ecosystem functionining an interactions among its components. Silvicultural models are an important tool to predict forest response to different scenarios. The lack of knowledge on many of the processes that compose the dehesa system made impossible the implementation of a global systemic model. For this reason, in this dissertation we studied sepparately three different fundamental elements of the dehesa, namely tree growth and its response to climate, fruit production and tree- grass interactions, to increase knowledge on the different elements of the system with the final aim of implementing a systemic model in the next future. We started building the first dendrochronology for the holm oak in dehesas, validating the use of annual growth estimation from crossections to fit growth models. The stands studied are responding to climate warming by expanding the growth period in fall and showing greater symptoms of water stress in summer. In addition, they shared a climatic signal with certain tree chronologies from the Mediterranean Region. After building the chronology we fitted dinamic diameter growth models for the holm oak, comparing age dependent and age independent formulations. Dynamic age dependent models yielded predictions errors between 7 and 10% in the most abundant diameter classes within the system. Age independent models slightly increased the error (≈15%) compared to age dependent formulations but they can be very useful since age it is not necessary to be estimated. Diameter increment models were estimated to study competition in open stands like those encountered in dehesas, also comparing age dependent and age independent formulations. The models selected density as one of the significant covariates, hence there was competiton between trees, which most probably was symmetric competition between radical systems. Competition for light is reduced or absent in the system, and this was the reason explaining that age, or DBH as a substitute in age independent models, were the covariates explaining more variability. Gamma generalized linear models outcompeted log-transformed gaussian models, resulting in more parsimonious models. We followed analyzing the state of the art in acorn production, and concluded that despite the great importance of fruit production of the system, there are no detailed studies able to explain this complex phenomenon, hence making system modeling today impossible.Finally we studied the effect of the tree upon the understory, discussing the spatial and temporal variability of an interaction traditionaly believed to be static and constant. In average, grass production was higher below the canopy in the poorest soils. However, tree-grass interaction was variable in time and space, changing the interaction when abiotic water stressed increased in the drought year. Nutrient increase below canopy drove the increase in production, however and in spite of other authors reporting opposite results, it did not increase grass tissue nutrient concentration, with the exception of K and to a lower extent Ca. Modifications by trees in the understory, particularly pasture quality, seem to be most related to year variability, hence spatial variability induced by trees seems to be very reduced compared to variability driven by climate. These models will help to model the system, but there are still unresolved questions, like fruit production or the effect of different silvicultural practices upon growth, that make still not possible to implement a complete systemic model.;10.20868/UPM.thesis.1708;https://doi.org/10.20868/UPM.thesis.1708;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;x;;;;

The studied grassland responded to increased nutrient availability • Contrary to what was expected, plant nutrient concentrations did not directly reflect those found in by enhancing growth and changing botanical composition rather than by increasing plant nutrient concentrations. Hence, the total amount of accumulated nutrients in the ecosystem was larger below the tree than outside it, although this is mainly a consequence of plant growth enhancement. The levels of Ca, Mg, and Na in plants decreased during the driest year, and the N content was mostly determined by the composition of the grass. nutrient concentration, while spatial variability induced by trees was determined to be of secondary • Temporal nutrient variability, particularly within-years, explained most of the variability in plant importance. These results are significant for ecosystem nutrient modelling. Résumé;10.1051/forest/2009091;https://doi.org/10.1051/forest/2009091;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;x;;;;

The introduction of tillage techniques along particular theoretical lines, called keylines, can make a significant contribution to improving the management of the soil and agricultural crops. The keyline system has been around for less than 100 years. With this preliminary work, we performed a comparative analysis of two small river basins (less than 100 ha) before and after keyline application, based on GIS computational models (TWI and SIMWE). The calculation models were elaborated starting from a DTM with 2 m resolution, obtained from a LIDAR survey. The comparative analysis, in qualitative terms, showed a positive effect of the keylines, both in terms of erodibility and infiltration of runoff water. The use of GIS models to verify the effectiveness in the planning phase can constitute a decision support system that guides agronomists, technicians, and farmers.;10.3390/land12010100;https://doi.org/10.3390/land12010100;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;keyline study only;
R7XRX3HH;2010;Gomez-del-Campo, Maria;Physiological and growth responses to irrigation of a newly established hedgerow olive orchard;Olive production in the first few years after planting depends on how the canopy covers the hedgerow and develops flowers. Therefore, optimum irrigation management should look for the minimum amount of water required for maximum growth and bud initiation. The response of a young hedgerow olive orchard to different irrigation strategies was recorded for 3 years after planting in 2003. Observations included stem water potential (ψstem), leaf conductance (gl), shoot and trunk growth, canopy development, and flowering. During the first year, olives received 74 mm of irrigation. During the second and third years, three irrigation treatments (T2, T3, and T4) were scaled back from a control (T1) that was irrigated to maintain soil close to water-holding capacity. T1 received 56 and 106 mm of irrigation in the second and third years, respectively. Treatments T2, T3, and T4 received 82%, 64%, and 46% of the water applied to T1 in the second year and 76%, 72%, and 29% in the third year of growth, respectively. Trees in T1 displayed different physiological and growth behaviors between years. ψstem, gl, and shoot growth were 131%, 31%, and 56% lower in the third than in the second year, respectively. Irrigation treatment had no significant effect on evaluated parameters in the second year, except on ψstem in T4 that fell below that of the other treatments in late September. In the third year, shoot growth, trunk diameter, and leaf area density in T4 decreased 52%, 13%, and 31% compared with T1, respectively. Nevertheless, external surface area and canopy volume were not significantly affected by irrigation treatment. The start of flowering, recorded in the third and fourth years, was not significantly affected by the irrigation received in previous years. Because water stress did not advance flowering, maximum growth should be the main objective in irrigation management of young olive orchards. No differences were observed between T3 and T1 in any of the vegetative, canopy development, or inflorescence parameters recorded, although ψstem and gl were significantly lower in T3. During the second and third years, T3 can be considered the most efficient irrigation treatment with 36 and 76 mm of irrigation for each year, respectively.;10.21273/hortsci.45.5.809;https://doi.org/10.21273/hortsci.45.5.809;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;effects of irrigation on new olive hedge system;
YJCUXBGV;2020;"Grosdidier, Marie; Scordia, Thomas; Ioos, Renaud; Marçais, Benoit";Landscape epidemiology of ash dieback;Abstract Ash dieback is induced by Hymenoscyphus fraxineus , an invasive pathogenic fungus. It is causing severe damage to European ash populations. However, the local environment, such as climate or site conditions, is known to affect ash dieback. We studied the landscape epidemiology of the disease on a 22 km 2 area in north‐eastern France at two stages of the invasion process using Bayesian spatio‐temporal models fitted with integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA). Several features characterizing disease severity, crown dieback, frequency of collar canker and density of infected leaf debris in the litter were determined on a regular grid over a 3.5 × 6.5 km area. We first analysed the effect of landscape features on the disease establishment stage in 2012, 2 years after the first report of the disease in the area, and then on further disease development, in 2016–2018. Landscape features had little impact on the disease at the establishment stage, but strongly determined its further development. Local fragmentation of tree cover was the most important factor, with trees that are isolated or in hedges far less affected than trees in a forest environment. We showed that they were subjected to different microclimates, with higher crown temperatures unfavourable to pathogen development. Low host density strongly reduced disease development. The presence of large ash populations in the vicinity affected local disease severity up to several hundred metres. Synthesis . We showed that the landscape characteristics strongly affect the development and spread of ash dieback. The disease is far less severe in forest conditions when ash density is low or in open canopies such as hedges and isolated trees. Ash trees are often in these types of landscapes, which should strongly limit the overall impact of ash dieback. , Résumé La chalarose est causée par Hymenoscyphus fraxineus , un champignon pathogène invasif. Il induit des dommages importants dans les populations de frênes européens. Toutefois, on sait que l’environnement local, tel que le climat où les conditions stationnelles, affecte le développement de la chalarose. Nous avons étudié comment le paysage influence l’épidémiologie de la maladie sur une zone de 22 km² dans le NE de la France à deux étape du processus invasif en utilisant des modèles spatio-temporels bayésiens ajustés avec l’approximation « integrated nested Laplace » (INLA). Plusieurs paramètres de développement de l’épidémie, dépérissement des houppiers, fréquence de chancres aux collets, et densité de débris de feuilles infectés dans la litière, ont été mesurés sur un grille régulière sur une zone de 3.5 x 6.5 km. Nous avons d’abord analysé l’effet du paysage sur l’établissement de la maladie, en 2012, deux après son arrivée sur la zone, puis sur son développement ultérieur, en 2016–2018. Le paysage a peu influencé la colonisation initiale de la zone étudiée, mais a fortement conditionné le développement ultérieur de la maladie. La fragmentation locale du couvert arboré s’est révélé le facteur le plus important, les arbres isolés ou dans les haies étant beaucoup moins affectés que les arbres en couvert forestier fermé. Nous avons montré qu’ils étaient soumis à des microclimats différents, avec des températures dans les couronnes trop élevées et défavorables au développement de l’agent pathogène. Une faible densité d’hôte réduit aussi fortement le développement de la maladie. La présence de fortes populations de frênes dans un voisinage de plusieurs centaines de mètre affecte le développement local de la maladie. Synthèse . Nous avons montré que le paysage affecte fortement le développement de la chalarose du frêne. La maladie est beaucoup moins sévère en forêt quand la densité locale de frêne est faible ou bien dans les couverts ouverts (haies, arbres isolés). Les frênes sont fréquents dans ces types de situations, ce qui devrait fortement limiter l’impact global de la chalarose.;10.1111/1365-2745.13383;https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.13383;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8ADINFY7;2007;"Guevara-Escobar, Aurelio; Kemp, Peter D; Mackay, Alec D; Hodgson, John";Pasture production and composition under poplar in a hill environment in New Zealand;Traditionally, poplar (Populus spp.) have been planted to control erosion on New Zealand’s hill-slopes because of their capacity to dry out and bind together the soil. Two systems: (1) widely spaced, planted poplar for soil conservation, and (2) non-eroded open pasture were compared to determine the relative effect of the poplar– pasture system on the production, nutritive value and species composition of the pasture, and on the water balance. Measurements were made at three siteswithmature poplar (>29 years and 37–40 stem- sha–1) and at a replicated experiment with young poplar (5 years, 50–100 stems ha–1). Soil water relations did not suggest strong competition for water between poplar and pasture. Pasture accumu- lation under mature poplar was 40% less than in the open pasture, but under young poplar was similar to that in the open pasture. Chemical composition of pasture suggested that feed quality of pasture in the open was better than under the poplar canopy, except during spring, when most chemical compo- nents were similar. At the most, in vitro digestibility of pasture dry matter was 8.9% lower and metabol- isable energy of pasture dry matter was 1.5 MJ kg lower under the poplar canopy than in the open pasture. Shade tolerant specieswerenotdominant in the plant community under the poplar canopy with grasses such as browntop (Agrostis capillaris,L.) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne, L.) being a high propor- tion of theplant community.Differences in chemical composition were related to differences in the botanical composition between the open pasture and the poplar understorey. It was concluded that the greatest effect of poplar was on pasture produc- tion due to shading, and that management of this silvopastoral systemneeds to focus on control of the tree canopy to lessen the decrease in pasture production.;10.1007/s10457-007-9038-9;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-007-9038-9;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
WWJQR4AU;2021;"Guillot, Esther; Bertrand, Isabelle; Rumpel, Cornelia; Gomez, Claudia; Arnal, Didier; Abadie, Josiane; Hinsinger, Philippe";Spatial heterogeneity of soil quality within a Mediterranean alley cropping agroforestry system: Comparison with a monocropping system;Alley cropping agroforestry systems are complex agroecosystems highlighted for their positive effects on soil quality. However, the potential spatial heterogeneity of soil quality created by tree rows at the plot scale has seldom been studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate soil quality at the plot scale, under tree rows and along transects perpendicular to the tree row and to compare alley cropping systems with monocropping systems. This study was performed on an alley cropping system that combined hybrid walnut trees (21 years old) and peas. Topsoil was sampled at tree rows between 1 and 2, 2 and 4 and 4 and 6.5 m from the tree row in the alley cropping system, as well as in a neighbouring monocropping plot. Physical, chemical and microbiological indicators of soil quality were measured. Tree row implantation induced spatial heterogeneity in the chemical indicators, microbial biomass, activities and community structure at the alley cropping plot scale. Alley cropping not only improved microbiological soil quality indicators within the tree rows but also in the interrows when compared to a monocropping system. These indicators were then integrated into one soil quality index (SQI) built through a statistical approach. The soil quality index was calculated for the monocropping plot and for each position within the alley cropping plot. After 21 years of agroforestry practice, tree rows and permanent grass cover improved the SQI until 2 m in the interrow. Weighted SQIs were calculated relative to the surface area of each location for the entire alley cropping plot (i.e., tree row + interrow positions) and for the entire alley cropping interrow (i.e., removing the tree row surface area). The weighted SQI of the entire alley cropping plot significantly increased compared with that of the monocropping plot.;10.1016/j.ejsobi.2021.103330;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejsobi.2021.103330;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MKB3B3MR;2017;"He, Yufeng; Jones, Pippa J.; Rayment, Mark";A simple parameterisation of windbreak effects on wind speed reduction and resulting thermal benefits to sheep;"It is well known that windbreaks can provide favourable conditions for livestock. Determining the benefit of any given windbreak system first requires that the impact of the windbreak on the wind microclimate is characterised, but in practice, modelling wind flow around obstacles is complex and computationally intensive. We report a simple parameterised model to estimate the wind speed reduction around a windbreak. Analytically, model parameters showed close links to the real-world attributes that characterise windbreaks. The model was validated with field measurements on a farmland in the UK; a Monte Carlo simulation was used to measure model parameter uncertainties. Results showed that the model produced an excellent fit to the relative wind speed (i.e. normalized by ambient wind speed) with root-mean-square error of 4% ± 0.5%. The model was further applied to literature data to characterise the dependence of the relative wind speed on windbreak porosity. A field-scale simulation of a sheep grazing system, including an explicit description of wind-chill effects, was conducted to estimate the net gain associated with including a windbreak in sheep productivity. The maximum productivity gain (27%) was found at a porosity of 0.5 and a wind speed of 12 m/s. Wind-chill effects were further simulated for lowland and upland environments, and related to ovine-specific thermal tolerance limits. Results showed a distinct response to reduced wind speeds between sites, indicating different levels of thermal risk to livestock and different, microclimate-specific, windbreak benefits for each location. The simplified models proposed in this study provides a generic framework for an efficient and precise quantification of windbreak effects and optimising the design of windbreak systems.";10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.02.032;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.02.032;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SXQU5PK6;2018;"Hernández-Morcillo, Mónica; Burgess, Paul; Mirck, Jaconette; Pantera, Anastasia; Plieninger, Tobias";Scanning agroforestry-based solutions for climate change mitigation and adaptation in Europe;Agroforestry, the integration of trees and shrubs with livestock and/or crops, can make a substantial contribution to mitigating and enabling adaptation to climate change. However, its full potential will only be achieved if the challenges to agroforestry implementation are identified and the most efficient and sustainable solutions are made widely known. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to explore these challenges and to determine the most suitable set of solutions for each challenge that combines local effectiveness with European scale relevance. We performed a two-step “solution scanning” exercise. First, the main challenges to sustainable agroforestry in Europe were identified through 42 participatory workshops with 665 local stakeholders. The solutions to each challenge were scanned and classified into either direct solutions (28) to address climate change or indirect solutions (32) that improve the sustainability of agroforestry. In a second step, the direct solutions were prioritized through expert consultation in terms of their potential benefits for mitigation and adaptation. The most commonly reported barriers were a lack of knowledge and reliable financial support to which the most widely suggested indirect solutions were agroforestry training programmes and the development of safe economic routes. The direct solutions considered as holding the greatest mitigation and adaptation potential were the adoption of practices capable to increase soil organic carbon pools and the implementation of multifunctional hedgerow and windbreaks respectively. We believe that our solution scanning approach could contribute to the implementation of the European climate strategy in general and to the Common Agricultural Policy in particular by pointing to concrete climate beneficial actions.;10.1016/j.envsci.2017.11.013;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2017.11.013;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Scattered trees of these ecosystems could potentially mitigate the impact of climate change on herbaceous plant community but this issue has not yet tested experimentally. We carried out a field manipulative experiment of increased temperature (+2–3 °C) using Open Top Chambers and rainfall reduction (30%) through rain-exclusion shelters to evaluate how net primary productivity and digestibility respond to climate change over three consecutive years, and to test whether scattered trees could buffer the effects of higher aridity in Mediterranean dehesas. First, we observed that herbaceous communities located beneath tree canopy were less productive (351 g/m2) than in open grassland (493 g/m2) but had a higher digestibility (44% and 41%, respectively), likely promoted by tree shade and the higher soil fertility of this habitat. Second, both habitats responded similarly to climate change in terms of net primary productivity, with a 33% increase under warming and a 13% decrease under reduced rainfall. In contrast, biomass digestibility decreased under increased temperatures (−7.5%), since warming enhanced the fiber and lignin content and decreased the crude protein content of aerial biomass. This warming-induced effect on biomass digestibility only occurred in open grasslands, suggesting a buffering role of trees in mitigating the impact of climate change. Third, warming did not only affect these ecosystem processes in a direct way but also indirectly via changes in plant functional composition. Our findings suggest that climate change will alter both the quantity and quality of pasture production, with expected warmer conditions increasing net primary productivity but at the expense of reducing digestibility. This negative effect of warming on digestibility might be mitigated by scattered trees, highlighting the importance of implementing strategies and suitable management to control tree density in these ecosystems.;10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155535;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155535;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The planting of willow and poplar trees is one option used to provide green fodder during drought. How- ever, there is a wide concern that such an option can reduce the overall understorey pasture growth. This study evaluated the comparative establishment and growth of densely planted young willow and poplar and their effects on understorey pasture growth. Two experiments were established for 2 years in Palmer- ston North and Masterton, North Island, New Zealand. In the first experiment, densely planted willow and poplar significantly reduced understorey pasture growth by 24 and 9%, respectively, mainly due to shade, but coupled with soil moisture deficit in summer. In the second experiment, pasture growth in a willow browse block was 52% of that in open pasture as a result of shade and differences in pasture species composition and management. Willow and poplar survival rates were similar (P[0.05) after 2 years of establishment (100 vs. 90.5%, respec- tively). However, willow grew faster than poplar in height (1.90 vs. 1.35 m), stem diameter (43.5 vs. 32.6 mm), canopy diameter (69 vs. 34 cm) and number of shoots (8.7 vs. 2.3) at the age of 2 years.;10.1007/s10457-008-9195-5;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-008-9195-5;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The aim of this study was to evaluate, in a sub-humid Mediterranean climate, the behavior of the yield components, phenology, LAI and NDVI of durum wheat in an alley-cropping system. Our hypothesis was that the microclimate changes in agroforestry could change the devlelopment and yield of cereals. Two different experiments were carried out: in 2015 under 16-year old poplars in East–West lines and in 2016 under 21-year-old ash trees in North–South lines. In each experiment, 12 genotypes of durum wheat were sown. The grain yield was not significantly different in agroforestry and full sun conditions in 2015; however, both systems in this experiment had a particularly low yield (≈ 10% of the historical average yield of the plot). In 2016, the grain yield was significantly lower in agroforestry in comparison with full sun conditions. In both experiments, the most impacted yield component by agroforestry was the number of grains per spike. Similarly, in both experiments, the number of grains per spike was the only yield component impacted by the position within the alley inside agroforestry. Surprisingly, in 2016 the grain yield was higher in the West than in the center position of the alley. In both experiments, agroforestry delayed the maturity of the crop. The use of standard growing degree days was not sufficient to explain the difference in phenology between agroforestry and full sun conditions.";10.1007/s10457-018-0201-2;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-018-0201-2;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7LAXJ8IU;2015;"Jakobsen, Malene; Preda, Teodora; Kongsted, Anne; Hermansen, John";Increased Foraging in Outdoor Organic Pig Production—Modeling Environmental Consequences;"Consumers’ motivations for buying organic products include a wish of acquiring healthy, environmentally friendly products from production systems that also ensure a high level of animal welfare. However, the current Danish organic pig production faces important challenges regarding environmental impact of the system. High ammonia emissions arise from outdoor concrete areas with growing-finishing pigs and sows on pasture possess an increased risk of nitrogen (N) leaching. Direct foraging in the range area is suggested as a way to improve the nutrient efficiency at farm level and to support a more natural behavior of the pig. Thus, by modeling, we investigated the environmental consequences of two alternative scenarios with growing-finishing pigs foraging in the range area and different levels of crops available for foraging; grass-clover (lowest integration of forage) or a combination of lucerne, grass-clover and Jerusalem artichokes (highest integration of forage). It was possible to have growing-finishing pigs on free-range without increasing N leaching compared to the current practice. The alternative system with lucerne, grass-clover and Jerusalem artichokes showed the lowest carbon footprint with 3.12 CO2 eq kg−1 live weight pig compared to the current Danish pasture based system with 3.69 kg CO2 eq kg−1 live weight pig. Due to positive impact on soil carbon sequestration, the second alternative system based on grass-clover showed a similar carbon foot print compared to current practice with 3.68 kg CO2 eq kg−1 live weight pig. It is concluded that in practice there is room for development of organic pig production systems where direct foraging plays a central role.";10.3390/foods4040622;https://doi.org/10.3390/foods4040622;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A total of 128 sows were used during warm weather (May to August 2001) to determine the effects of unshaded (control; n = 8) vs. shaded (SH; n = 8) wallows. Sows ranged over 6 parities and were fed a completely balanced sorghum-based diet. Behavioral data were collected by 15-min scan samples over a 24-h period/wk for a total of 16 wk. All sows were observed twice when litter age was 5 and 15 d, respectively. Respiration rates (breaths/min) were collected on 50 sows (control, n = 25; SH, n = 25) over an 8-wk period when the maximum temperature exceeded 32°C. Ten milliliters of clotted blood and 20 mL of whole blood were obtained by jugular puncture from each sow on the day of weaning to determine total white blood cells, acute phase proteins, packed-cell volume, and Chemotaxis and chemokinesis. Descriptive water temperature profiles were measured by using data loggers positioned at 3 levels per wallow: surface water, shallow mud, and deep mud. Behavioral, postural, location, performance, and physiological measurements did not differ (P > 0.05) among wallow treatments. Regardless of treatment, sows spent approximately 82% of their total time budget inside the farrowing hut and only approximately 7% of their total time budget in the wallow. A total of 428 piglets died, 219 in the control treatment and 209 in the SH treatment. The majority of piglets in both treatments died of crushing within the first 72 h after parturition, and most of the piglets had suckled. Shade kept the shallow water profile cooler during the hotter afternoon temperatures compared with the control wallows. In SH for both the shallow and deep mud profiles, temperatures were consistent throughout the day. In conclusion, sows spent a large percentage of their daily time budget inside the farrowing hut and spent only brief episodes in the wallow. Shading the wallow did not result in increased wallow use time or improvements in sow physiology and overall performance. © 2008 American Society of Animal Science.

HWKMPS96;2019;"Jose, Shibu; Dollinger, Jeanne";Silvopasture: a sustainable livestock production system;"Silvopasture, as an integrated land use practice that combines trees, forage and livestock, has been in existence for millennia. There are many variants of this land use in both the temperate and tropical regions of the world practiced at small and large scales. Modern silvopasture; however, is not just a new name for an old practice. It is rooted in sound ecological principles and demands skills in managing complexity. Scientific evidence of the ecological and economic benefits of silvopasture has been accumu- lating rapidly over the last few years and hence the objective of this thematic issue was to bring together a collection of original research and review articles that dealt with these different dimensions. There are 28 articles included in this thematic issue categorized into four groups based on their primary focus, (1) forage production and quality (2) livestock performance (3) environmental benefits, and (4) challenges in design- ing and developing silvopasture. The information presented has deepened our understanding of some of the biophysical and socioeconomic dimensions of silvopastoral systems; however, it also has revealed some of the research gaps. Addressing these research gaps will help improve not only the economic and environmental sustainability of these systems, but their social acceptability as well.";10.1007/s10457-019-00366-8;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-019-00366-8;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The experiment was conducted at Embrapa Beef Cattle in Campo Grande, state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, from July to September 2013. The evaluations were conducted on four consecutive days, from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., local time (GMT −4:00), with 1 hour intervals, recording the microclimate parameters: air temperature (°C), black globe temperature (°C), wet bulb temperature (°C), relative humidity (%), and wind speed (m.s−1), for the subsequent calculation of the Temperature and Humidity Index, the Black Globe Temperature and Humidity Index, and the Radiant Thermal Load. The largest changes in microclimate parameters were found in the full sun, between 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m., in less dense eucalyptus system, followed by the scattered native trees system, resulting in a maximum Temperature and Humidity Index of 81, Black Globe Temperature and Humidity Index of 88 and Radiant Thermal Load of 794 W m−2. Therefore, it is observed that with the presence of trees in pastures were possible reductions of up to 3.7 % in Temperature and Humidity Index, 10.2 % in the Black Globe Temperature and Humidity Index, and 28.3 % of the Radiant Thermal Load in the shade. Thus, one can conclude that the presence of trees and their arrangement in the systems provide better microclimate conditions and animal thermal comfort in pastures.;10.1007/s00484-016-1180-5;https://doi.org/10.1007/s00484-016-1180-5;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8QGVPS8B;2022;"Kusuma, Purba Daru; Dinimaharawati, Ashri";Fixed Step Average and Subtraction Based Optimizer;This work proposes a new metaheuristic algorithm: a fixed-step average and subtraction-based optimizer (FS-ASBO). This algorithm is the improved version of the average and subtraction-based optimizer (ASBO). There are several improvements related to the original ASBO. First, the proposed algorithm replaces the randomized step size in the guided movement with the fixed step size. Second, the proposed algorithm adds an exploration mechanism after the guided movement in every iteration when the new candidate fails to find a better solution. This proposed algorithm is then implemented into a simulation to evaluate its performance. Through simulation, the proposed algorithm is challenged to solve theoretical optimization problems and real-world optimization problems. The 23 well-known benchmark functions represent the theoretical optimization problem. Meanwhile, the housing optimization problem represents the real-world one. In the simulation, the proposed algorithm is compared with particle swarm optimization (PSO), marine predator algorithm (MPA), Komodo mlipir algorithm (KMA), static Komodo algorithm (SKA), and ASBO. The result shows that this proposed algorithm is competitive to solve theoretical problem and superior to solve real-world problem. The proposed algorithm outperforms all sparing algorithms in solving seven functions. In housing optimization problem, it creates 12%, 10%, 8%, 11%, and 10% better total gross profit than the ASBO, PSO, MPA, KMA, and SKA.;10.22266/ijies2022.0831.31;https://doi.org/10.22266/ijies2022.0831.31;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
5BT2Y9KM;2009;"Lange, B; Lüescher, P; Germann, P F";Significance of tree roots for preferential infiltration in stagnic soils;It is generally recognized that roots have an effect on infiltration. In this study we analysed the relation between root length distributions from Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst), silver fir (Abies alba Miller), European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and preferential infiltration in stagnic soils in the northern Pre-Alps in Switzerland. We conducted irrigation experiments (1 m2) and recorded water content variations with time domain reflectometry (TDR). A rivulet approach was applied to characterise preferential infiltration. Roots were sampled down to a depth of 0.5 to 1 m at the same position where the TDR-probes had been inserted and digitally measured. The basic properties of preferential infil- tration, film thickness ofmobile water and the contact length between soil and mobile water in the horizontal plane are closely related to root densities. An increase in root density resulted in an increase in contact length, but a decrease in film thickness. We modelled water content waves based on root densities and identified a range ofroot densities that lead to a maximum volume flux density and infiltration capacity. These findings provide convincing evidence that tree roots in stagnic soils represent the pore system that carries preferen- tial infiltration. Thus, the presence of roots should improve infiltration;10.5194/hess-13-1809-2009;https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-13-1809-2009;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

L.; Rolo, V.; Benítez, R.; Moreno, G.";Shrub encroachment of Iberian dehesas: implications on total forage productivity;The Iberian dehesa, a grazed Mediterranean open woodland, is an outstanding example of a silvopastoral system. Shrub encroachment has been proposed as an effective method to facilitate natural tree regeneration and ensure the sustainability of silvopastoral systems. At the same time, shrubs can affect both pasture understory and tree overstory production. The effects of varying intensities of shrub encroachment on the productivity of four forage components of this system—pasture, acorns, shrub browse and tree browse—were tested and the overall metabolisable energy (ME) under different scenarios of vegetation structure was calculated. Two common shrub species with contrasting plant architectures and ecological functions were studied as models: Cistus ladanifer and Retama sphaerocarpa. Cistus negatively affected acorn, tree browse and pasture production, whereas Retama positively affected pasture and browse production and was neutral for acorn production. The highest ME values were found when tree cover was ca. 70 % and C. ladanifer cover was low or R. sphaerocarpa cover was medium. The authors recommend conserving and promoting patched three-layered plots in Iberian dehesas and similar extensive silvopastoral systems where certain shrub species could simultaneously encourage the sustainability of these systems and reinforce (with R. sphaerocarpa) or maintain (with C. ladanifer) their productivity.;10.1007/s10457-015-9793-y;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-015-9793-y;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
XQMRF2GQ;2014;"Lovreglio, R; Meddour-Sahar, O; Leone, V";Goat grazing as a wildfire prevention tool: a basic review;Fuel treatments aimed at reducing both horizontal and vertical continuity in fuels are of paramount importance as a prevention measure against fire propagation. Possible techniques include pruning, thinning (mainly low thin- ning), mastication, prescribed burning, and prescribed (or targeted) grazing. Their main target is crown fire avoidance by treating surface fuels and promo- ting low density and vertically discontinuous stands, thus eliminating fuel lad- ders. Grazing is an effective, nearly carbon-neutral weed control technique which is cost-effective, nontoxic, and nonpolluting. Goat grazing is a very in- teresting solution: if confined by a metallic or electrified fence within a re- stricted pen, with a rather high density, goats browse the available foliage and twigs from all woody plants as well as all herbaceous vegetation. They can feed on a variety of shrubs, some of which are useless for other domestic species, and are therefore the best adapted for the consumption of all the Mediterra- nean shrubs which represent the fuel ladder. The appropriate choice of season of grazing, type of plant species and type and amount of biomass to be elimi- nated, livestock density, social structure of the herd, grazing time per day, type of fencing, and size of pens define the prescribed grazing system.;10.3832/ifor1112-007;https://doi.org/10.3832/ifor1112-007;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Departing from the well- established concept of integrated pest management, we include pollinator management in a hierarchical decision support system of management actions. We depict this support system as an IPPM pyramid. Priority is given to proactive measures at the base of the pyramid, which are undertaken through landscape and crop field management of mobile organisms, primarily arthropods. Farther up the pyramid, practices in the form of reactive use of biotic and abiotic inputs should align with basal actions. The goal of IPPM is to minimize trade- offs, and to maximize co- benefits and synergies between pest and pollinator management. We contend that IPPM has the potential to contribute to sustainable pest control and crop pollination, as well as provide broader environmental benefits.;10.1002/fee.2325;https://doi.org/10.1002/fee.2325;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BFYH4D9J;2016;"Lunka, Peter; Patil, Sopan D.";Impact of tree planting configuration and grazing restriction on canopy interception and soil hydrological properties: Implications for flood mitigation in silvopastoral systems;Compaction of upper soil layers by intensive sheep grazing has been connected with increased local flood risk in silvopastoral systems. A 12-week field study was conducted at the Henfaes Research Station near Bangor, Wales to compare canopy interception, soil water infiltration, and bulk density between a control pasture and two silvopastoral tree planting configurations: trees clumped in fenced-off ungrazed plots and trees planted evenly and grazed. The study's aim was to characterize the potential of these tree planting configurations to reduce local flood risk. Automated throughfall gauges were installed in each silvopastoral treatment along with a similarly designed control gauge located in the grazed control pasture. Soil water infiltration and bulk density were measured 20 times in a stratified random design for each treatment and control. Results showed that the mean soil infiltration capacity in clumped configuration was 504% greater than the control pasture and 454% greater than the even spaced configuration. Average canopy interception was higher in the clumped configuration (34%) than in the even spaced configuration (28%). Soil bulk density was lower in the clumped configuration (0.87 Mg/m3) than in the control pasture (0.93 Mg/m3) and even spaced configuration (1 Mg/m3). Results suggest that silvopastoral systems are more likely to benefit from clumped and ungrazed tree configurations than from evenly-spaced and grazed tree configurations because of enhanced infiltration, lower soil compaction, and increased canopy interception. Our findings support the growing evidence base that fenced-off tree areas in silvopastoral settings can increase infiltration and thus reduce local flood risk.;10.1002/hyp.10630;https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.10630;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VBB2BPWT;2018;"Luske, Boki; Van Eekeren, Nick";Nutritional potential of fodder trees on clay and sandy soils;In this paper we focus on the functional role of trees for livestock as fodder in silvopastoral systems, available for (dairy) cows within or around pastures. Farmers often report that cows browse from trees, however, little is known about the nutritional value of different tree species. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the effect of soil type and season on the nutritional potential of leaves from Fraxinus excelsior, Alnus glutinosa and Salix vimi- nalis. Leaf samples were collected at 10 sites in the Netherlands on clay and on sandy soils in June, July and September and were analysed for digestibility, crude protein, macro and micro element concentra- tions. We conclude that the nutritional value of tree leaves differs between the studied tree species. Regarding the seasonal variation, we found a main effect of sampling period on the crude protein, calcium, phosphorus, copper and selenium concentra- tion of leaves. No main effect of soil type was found on the nutritional value of leaves. Significant interactions were found for species 9 sampling period (digestibil- ity, calcium, sulphur) and species 9 soil (digestibil- ity, calcium). For the zinc and selenium concentration in tree leaves, a significant species 9 soil 9 sampling period interaction was found. We conclude that trees can play a role for supplying protein, and macro and micro elements to livestock, but that it depends on which tree species is used;10.1007/s10457-017-0180-8;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-017-0180-8;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
WVE9JD45;2023;"Maliuha, Volodymyr; Sovakov, Oleksandr; Dudarets, Sergii";The current state of windbreaks of the Left Bank Forest Steppe of Ukraine;The relevance of the study is related to the need to determine the current state of windbreaks as a component of the forest-agrarian landscape of a particular region. The purpose of the study is to conduct a comprehensive assessment of windbreaks. During the study, data from remote sensing of the Earth using satellite imagery was utilised, which allowed for determining field parameters, the placement of the windbreak system, and their characteristics. Forest inventory works were conducted using commonly accepted methods in forest mensuration, with adjustments made specifically for windbreaks. The quality class of windbreaks was determined based on the percentage of healthy trees out of the total number, and the sanitary condition index was calculated according to established categories. The analysis of the obtained data clearly shows a decline in the quality sequence of common oak from 9 to 3 units within the plantations. The windbreaks were created using the method of oak nest planting, with oak nests placed at a spacing of 5.0×3.0 m and a total windbreak width of 15.0 m. Two additional rows of companion trees were introduced in the wide 5-metre alleys, and companion and shrub species were added within the nest rows. The analysis of the characteristics of windbreaks showed that they have protective heights ranging from 19.6 m to 23.4 m and provide reliable protection for adjacent agricultural fields. Based on the range of effective protective effects of windbreaks, it can be noted that the calculated indicators provide protection with a reliable safety margin of up to 17%. If there is a need to create new windbreaks using the nest planting method in the future, a more efficient scheme is proposed, which involves placing companion tree species in the outer rows to prevent the crowns of the inner rows from spreading towards the field. As a result of the obtained findings, it became possible to conduct a comprehensive expert assessment of the state of windbreaks according to the following criteria: forestry and inventory parameters, meliorative properties, and the sanitary condition index;10.31548/forest/2.2023.53;https://doi.org/10.31548/forest/2.2023.53;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this study, the effects of inclusion ofpoplar trees in paddocks for lactating sows on nitrogen (N) balances were studied for an organic pig farm in Denmark. Vegetation conditions, soil water and nitrate dy- namics were measured in poplar and grass zones ofpaddocks belonging to main treatments: access to trees (AT), no access to trees (NAT) and a control without trees (NT), during the hydrological year April 2015 to April 2016. Soil water drainage for each zone, simulated by two simulation models (CoupModel and Daisy), was used to es- timate nitrate leaching from the zones in each paddock. Nbalances (input minus output) for the treatmentswere computed and compared. The results showed that, in terms of annual water balance and regardless of treatment, simulated evapotranspi- ration ofpoplarwas 560–569 and 489–498mmfor CoupModel and Daisy, respectively, and corresponding evapo- transpiration of grass-clover was 250 and 400 mm, against precipitation of1076 mm. Simulated drainage below the root zone varied as 620–723mmfor Daisy and 568–958mmfor CoupModel, the higher end ofthe latter being probably overestimated. Annual nitrate leaching ranged from 32 kg N ha−1 in the poplar zone of NAT up to 289 kg N ha−1 in the control grass zone ofNT. The poplar zone showed significantly lower nitrate leaching, by 75–80%, compared to the grass zone. For the control NT treatment, nitrate leaching was approximately 50% higher in the grass zone closest to the hut compared to the grass zone further away. NT treatment also had the largest surface N balance of 468 kg N ha−1 compared to 436 and 397 kg N ha−1 for AT and NAT, respectively. When N losses by leaching and volatilisation were included, soil N balances were 118, 157 and 113 kg N ha−1 for AT, NATandNT, respectively. Overall, the two simulationmodels were found useful tools for analyses ofwater balance for complex agroforestry systems. The findings collectively suggest that it is possible to decrease nitrate leaching fromoutdoor pig production on sandy soils by inclusion ofpoplar trees. Additional measures are never- theless needed to reduce N losses on a mean area basis in paddocks with 20% tree cover;10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.376;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.376;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BZAQ28L6;2023;"Masters, David G.; Blache, Dominique; Lockwood, Amy L.; Maloney, Shane K.; Norman, Hayley C.; Refshauge, Gordon; Hancock, Serina N.";Shelter and shade for grazing sheep: implications for animal welfare and production and for landscape health;"Shade and shelter may provide protection from cold and heat stress, a source of feed during prolonged or seasonal drought, specific essential nutrients, increased pasture and crop production and improved landscape health. Cold stress contributes to the average of 8% (single) and 24% (twin) of lambs that die within 3 days of birth in Australia and the estimated 0.7% of the Australian flock that die post-shearing during extreme or unseasonal weather. Shelter has resulted in an average reduction in mortality of 17.5% for twin-born lambs and 7% for single-born lambs according to Australian studies and decreases the susceptibility of ewes to metabolic disease and possibly dystocia. Because many of the published studies are from research areas where cold stress is expected, they are not indicative of industry-wide responses, a research priority is to determine the probability of lamb and ewe deaths from cold stress across different sheep production areas. Although shelter may improve lamb survival, ewes do not always choose to lamb in a sheltered location. For this reason, there is a requirement for research into the voluntary use of shelter in commercial-sized paddocks and the role that nutritive value of shelter plays in attracting and holding ewes to shelter, and to their lambs. Heat stress may also result in lamb deaths and influences feed conversion efficiency, appetite, reproduction, wool growth and disease susceptibility. The consequences of heat stress may go unnoticed over a yearly production cycle, although there is some evidence that shade may increase weaning rates and feed intake of grazing sheep. There are ancillary benefits from shade and shelter. Trees may improve crop production through reducing wind damage and evapotranspiration and provide timber. Shrubs provide feed during the summer–autumn feed gap or drought, are useful for the management of land degradation and provide habitat for native fauna. It is clear that shade and shelter in the correct locations provide a range of benefits to livestock and the landscape; nevertheless, adoption appears low. Research that focuses on defining the benefits on a farm or landscape scale is required to support extension programs.";10.1071/AN22225;https://doi.org/10.1071/AN22225;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
U7GZLXFL;2004;"Miao, Z. H.; Glatz, P. C.; Ru, Y. J.";Review of Production, Husbandry and Sustainability of Free-range Pig Production Systems;"A review was undertaken to obtain information on the sustainability of pig free-range production systems including the management, performance and health of pigs in the system. Modern outdoor rearing systems requires simple portable and flexible housing with low cost fencing. Local pig breeds and outdoor-adapted breeds for certain environment are generally more suitable for free-range systems. Free-range farms should be located in a low rainfall area and paddocks should be relatively flat, with light topsoil overlying free-draining subsoil with the absence of sharp stones that can cause foot damage. Huts or shelters are crucial for protecting pigs from direct sun burn and heat stress, especially when shade from trees and other facilities is not available. Pigs commonly graze on strip pastures and are rotated between paddocks. The zones of thermal comfort for the sow and piglet differ markedly; between 12-22°C for the sow and 30-37°C for piglets. Offering wallows for free-range pigs meets their behavioural requirements, and also overcomes the effects of high ambient temperatures on feed intake. Pigs can increase their evaporative heat loss via an increase in the proportion of wet skin by using a wallow, or through water drips and spray. Mud from wallows can also coat the skin of pigs, preventing sunburn. Under grazing conditions, it is difficult to control the fibre intake of pigs although a high energy, low fibre diet can be used. In some countries outdoor sows are fitted with nose rings to prevent them from uprooting the grass. This reduces nutrient leaching of the land due to less rooting. In general, free-range pigs have a higher mortality compared to intensively housed pigs. Many factors can contribute to the death of the piglet including crushing, disease, heat stress and poor nutrition. With successful management, free-range pigs can have similar production to door pigs, although the growth rate of the litters is affected by season. Piglets grow quicker indoors during the cold season compared to outdoor systems. Pigs reared outdoors show calmer behaviour. Aggressive interactions during feeding are lower compared to indoor pigs while outdoor sows are more active than indoor sows. Outdoor pigs have a higher parasite burden, which increases the nutrient requirement for maintenance and reduces their feed utilization efficiency. Parasite infections in free-range pigs also risks the image of free-range pork as a clean and safe product. Diseases can be controlled to a certain degree by grazing management. Frequent rotation is required although most farmers are keeping their pigs for a longer period before rotating. The concept of using pasture species to minimise nematode infections in grazing pigs looks promising. Plants that can be grown locally and used as part of the normal feeding regime are most likely to be acceptable to farmers, particularly organic farmers. However, one of the key concerns from the public for free-range pig production system is the impact on the environment. In the past, the pigs were held in the same paddock at a high stocking rate, which resulted in damage to the vegetation, nutrient loading in the soil, nitrate leaching and gas emission. To avoid this, outdoor pigs should be integrated in the cropping pasture system, the stock should be mobile and stocking rate related to the amount of feed given to the animals.";10.5713/ajas.2004.1615;https://doi.org/10.5713/ajas.2004.1615;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

According to recent literature, two adaptation solutions based on the concept of diversification can be explored. The first solution is crop diversification at the field level. Three main cropping systems, namely agroforestry, intercropping, and service crops, have been shown to increase soil water availability and to improve crop water use. The second solution is to consider diversification at the landscape level by diversifying crops and associated agricultural management practices (in number, abundance, and spatial organization) and building small-scale water-harvesting infrastructures (WHI). In order to move toward a sustainable MA, one of the main scientific challenges ahead is to provide knowledge and tools, such as integrated agro-hydrological models, useful to evaluate several spatiotemporal combinations of these solutions in order to optimize soil water availability and crop water use.;10.1016/j.cosust.2023.101336;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2023.101336;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The general equivalence of the latter indicates that, considered globally, hillslope soil production and erosion evolve to balance geologic and climate forcing, whereas conventional plow-based agriculture increases erosion rates enough to prove unsustainable. In contrast to how net soil erosion rates in conventionally plowed fields (≈1 mm/yr) can erode through a typical hillslope soil profile over time scales comparable to the longevity of major civilizations, no-till agriculture produces erosion rates much closer to soil production rates and therefore could provide a foundation for sustainable agriculture.;10.1073/pnas.0611508104;https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0611508104;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FDJKGAWV;2016;"Morandin, L. A.; Long, R. F.; Kremen, C.";Pest Control and Pollination Cost–Benefit Analysis of Hedgerow Restoration in a Simplified Agricultural Landscape;Field edge habitat in homogeneous agricultural landscapes can serve multiple purposes including enhanced biodiversity, water quality protection, and habitat for beneficial insects, such as native bees and natural enemies. Despite this ecosystem service value, adoption of field border plantings, such as hedgerows, on large-scale mono-cropped farms is minimal. With profits primarily driving agricultural production, a major challenge affecting hedgerow plantings is linked to establishment costs and the lack of clear economic benefits on the restoration investment. Our study documented that hedgerows are economically viable to growers by enhancing beneficial insects and natural pest control and pollination on farms. With pest control alone, our model shows that it would take 16 yr to break even from insecticide savings on the US$4,000 cost of a typical 300-m hedgerow field edge planting. By adding in pollination benefits by native bees, where honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) may be limiting, the return time is reduced to 7 yr. USDA cost share programs allow for a quicker return on a hedgerow investment. Our study shows that over time, small-scale restoration can be profitable, helping to overcome the barrier of cost associated with field edge habitat restoration on farms.;10.1093/jee/tow086;https://doi.org/10.1093/jee/tow086;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, a quantitative synthesis of the impact of agroforestry on soil health and associated ecosystem services in the humid and sub-humid tropics is still lacking. Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify the contribution of agroforestry practices to soil-mediated ecosystem services, specifically, regulation of soil erosion, storage of soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N), availability of soil N and phosphorus (P) to crops, and alleviation of soil acidity across the humid and sub-humid tropics. The analysis demonstrated that agroforestry can reduce soil erosion rates by 50% compared to crop monocultures. This finding is supported by higher infiltration rates, lower runoff, higher proportion of soil macroggregates, and greater stability of soil structure under agroforestry. SOC increased by 40%, N storage increased by 13%, available N by 46% and available P by 11% while soil pH increased by 2% under agroforestry compared to crop monocultures.

Pigs have developed a wide range of thermoregulatory behaviours that are particular for this species. With increases in temperature the most characteristic behaviour for pigs is decreased activity and in- creased wallowing in wet surfaces. In addition to this, rooting and wallowing are highly influenced by temperature and humidity. The lack of possibility to express these behaviours leads to develop- ment of stereotypies. Interestingly, low temperatures do not increase the use of shelter if not in combination with wind or precipitation. Furthermore, wild pigs build stronger nests in severe con- ditions. Also, resting behaviour and reproduction may be disturbed by high temperatures.

Black walnut (Juglans nigra L.) and honeylocust (Gleditisia triacanothose L.) based silvopasture systems were compared with open pastures in a randomized complete block design with three blocks over two summers. Behavior measures were recorded within a replicate within a week, and these measures were taken sequentially within three experimental periods. Ewe lambs (n = 3) within each experimental unit were equipped with a wideband audio-recording device to detect prehension events. Time-lapse cameras documented sheep behavior every 60 s. In the silvopastures, the lambs spent over 90% of daylight hours within shade from trees. Lambs in silvopastures spent more time lying down than animals in the open pastures (P ≤ 0.01), while lambs in the open pastures spent more than 2 h longer each day standing (P < 0.0001). Lambs in the black walnut silvopastures spent more time grazing (488 ± 14 min · d−1) than lambs in the honeylocust silvopastures (438 ± 14 min · d−1; P = 0.0493) and lambs in the open pastures (417 ± 14 min · d−1; P = 0.0026). There was no difference in grazing time for lambs in the latter two systems (P = 0.5597). Spectral analysis of the imagery revealed that the lambs in the black walnut silvopastures grazed more frequently than the lambs in the other systems for both years. The acoustic analysis, though limited by recorder durability to 47 complete recordings, revealed no difference in total bites taken per day (P ≥ 0.7222) or in the morning (P ≥ 0.2069), afternoon (P ≥ 0.5816), and evening periods (P ≥ 0.9337). Silvopastures provide an opportunity to improve lamb comfort in the summer.";10.1093/TAS/TXZ177;https://doi.org/10.1093/TAS/TXZ177;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
9KU778UD;2021;"Pent, Gabriel J; Fike, John H; Kim, Inyoung";Ewe lamb vaginal temperatures in hardwood silvopastures;Shade for livestock during periods of heat stress is likely to be one of the biggest drivers for silvopasture adoption by livestock producers, yet the degree of physiological benefit for animals in sil- vopastures is generally unquantified. The greatest challenge for measuring body temperatures and assessing heat stress in animals on pasture is in collecting the data while minimizing disturbance to the animal. In this study, intravaginal temperature sensors were constructed from blank controlled inter- nal drug release devices and small temperature loggers. Body temperatures of ewe lambs (n =9) were recorded within a replicate within a week, and these measures were taken sequentially within each of three experimental periods. During the hottest part of the day (1200–1900 h), ewe lambs in the open pasture had hotter vaginal temperatures than lambs in the black walnut (Juglans nigra) silvopastures (P B 0.0338). Ewe lambs in the honeylocust silvopas- tures (Gleditsia triacanthos) had cooler body temper- atures than lambs in the open pastures at 1500 h (P = 0.0469). Ewe lambs in the open pasture experi- enced more fluctuation in day to nighttime core temperature change (P\0.0001). Ewe lambs in the honeylocust silvopastures and the open pastures exhibited increasing vaginal temperatures each suc- cessive month. The trees within these silvopastures moderated the impact of ambient conditions on lamb body temperatures;10.1007/s10457-018-0221-y;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-018-0221-y;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
XC598585;2014;"Plante, Pierre-Manuel; Rivest, David; Vézina, André; Vanasse, Anne";Root distribution of different mature tree species growing on contrasting textured soils in temperate windbreaks;Aim We studied the vertical and lateral root distribution oftree species from three genera (Populus spp. - poplar, Picea spp. - spruce, Salix spp. - willow) that were planted in temperate windbreaks and assessed the ef- fects of soil texture on root density. Methods Root distribution to depths of up to 1 m was assessed using the trench-profile method at different dis- tances from the tree rows (2, 6 and 9 m) in 18 mature (average age, 25 years-old) windbreak-sites that were lo- cated on light- or heavy-textured agricultural soils in south- eastern Québec, Canada. Roots were classified into three diameter classes: fine (<1 mm), medium-size (1–5mm), and coarse (>5 mm). Results Tree fine-root density in poplar and willow windbreaks was higher than in spruce windbreaks at 2 m from the tree row. Root densities were higher in light compared to heavy soils, but these differences were specific to poplar and spruce. Across species groups and soil types, 67 % of the roots occurred in the uppermost 30 cm. In this soil zone, different soil fertility variables (pH, clay content, CEC) were negatively correlated with root density. Densities ofspruce and willow roots at 6 m from the tree row were much lower (and often unob- served) than that of poplar. At 9 m, low root densities were observed at only two sites. Conclusions We conclude that tree identity and soil type are important drivers ofroot distribution in temper- ate agroforestry systems. These results may have impor- tant implications for the management of tree competi- tion in agroforestry systems and several ecosystem ser- vices that are provided by roots, including C- sequestration, erosion control and water infiltration;10.1007/s11104-014-2108-7;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11104-014-2108-7;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The experiment consisted of 9 treatments comprising of 3 planting densities of each shrubs and H. binata in alternate row, viz. 312, 208 and 139/ha and 3 shrub species, viz. kath ber [Ziziphus xylopyrus (Retz.) Willd.]. Indian jujube [Z. mauritiana Lam.] and black cutch [Senegalia catechu (L.f.) P.J.H. Hurter & Mabb.]. Study revealed that Total green and dry top feed and fire wood obtained from pruning of Z. mauritiana and H. binata (0.87, 0.36 and 0.42 t/ha) were significantly higher than of Z. xylopyrus (0.77, 0.33 and 0.38 t/ha) and Senegalia catechu (0.67, 0.31 and 0.36 t/ha). Planting of H. binata and shrubs in alternate row at 6 m × 6 m spacing in 3 tier silvopasture system resulted in significantly higher green and dry-forage yield (17.64 and 5.58 t/ha) and crude pro-tein yield (542.5 kg/ha) of buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.) and caatingta stylo (Stylosanthes seabrana Maass & Maanetje) intercropping system as compared to 6 m × 4 m (17.23 and 5.43 t/ha and 529.2 kg/ha) and 4 m × 4 m spacing (16.93 and 5.31 t/ha and 512.6 kg/ha) respectively. Moisture content recorded after the monsoon season (October to April) was higher under Z. mauritiana (9.09, 9.55 and 10.20%) than S. xylopyrus (8.65, 9.12 and 9.77%) and A. catechu (8.63, 9.15 and 9.80%) at 0–15 cm, 15–30 cm and 30–60 cm soil depths, respectively. In soil fertility, higher planting density 312/ha of each shrubs and H. binata in alternate row resulted in improvement of available nutrients (N, 171.42; P, 7.03 and K, 158.81 kg/ha) and organic carbon (0.410%) than lower planting density 139/ha (N, 162.01; P, 6.64 and K, 150.87 kg/ha and organic carbon, 0.385%) in 6th year of the experiment.";10.59797/ija.v65i3.2976;https://doi.org/10.59797/ija.v65i3.2976;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SSGY9TEX;2016;"Rannow, Sven; Warner, Barbara";Anpassung an den Klimawandel als Herausforderung für Biosphärenreservate – das Beispiel Flusslandschaft Elbe-Brandenburg;Dealing with the effects of climate change poses new challenges for biosphere reserves as model regions for sustainable development. Although the impacts on ecosys- tems or landscapes can only be managed to a limited extent and are difficult to predict, the effects of climate change should be strategically addressed. Furthermore, it is neces- sary to involve numerous actors with various perspectives in the decisions that must be reached against a background of uncertain prognoses for the future. The paper uses the example of the UNESCO-Biosphere Reserve Elbe-Bran- denburg River Landscape to illustrate the concrete fields of action that are emerging and the possible work phases involved in a planned approach to dealing with climate change. Various measures relevant to landscape water bal- ance, vegetation, fauna and land use are demonstrated. On the Elbe, river basin management is particularly important. The discussion of possible strategic fields of action eluci- dates the roles that can be assumed by the administrations of biosphere reserves in a process of climate adaptation. The options and the extent to which biosphere reserves can develop into model regions for adaptation to climate change depend in practice on the capacities and expertise available.;10.1007/s13147-016-0425-4;https://doi.org/10.1007/s13147-016-0425-4;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Aims: The present work aimed at assessing productive and nutritional attributes of the foliage of the following four temperate tree species widespread in Europe: Acer pseudoplatanus, Fraxinus excelsior, Salix caprea and Sorbus aucuparia. Methods: Leaf length and biomass, proximate composition, fatty acid profile, phenolic composition and in vitro true dry matter digestibility were determined along the vegetative season. Key results: The leaf length of the four species was significantly related to leaf biomass and can be considered as a proficient proxy for estimating leaf biomass. The differences found among the species were remarkable, although weakly related to temporal changes, especially when considering fatty acid and phenolic compositions. Fraxinus excelsior sprouts were the most productive, with a mean biomass of 13.2 g dry matter (DM) per sprout at the end of the growing season. Its foliage showed also the lowest phenolic concentrations (average total extractable phenols of 11.25 g/kg DM), resulting in the highest digestibility values (average in vitro true dry matter digestibility of 56.5 g/kg DM). Digestibility of S. aucuparia was similar, but its lower polyunsaturated fatty acid concentration (average value of 62.13 g/kg DM) could reduce the interest for this species as a feeding resource for goat dairy products with healthy properties. The lower digestibility found for A. pseudoplatanus and S. caprea (average values of 43.3 and 46.2 g/kg DM, respectively) may be related to their higher phenolic concentrations (average total extractable phenols of 45.9 and 47.3 g/kg DM, respectively). Conclusions: The four species could represent an appealing feedstuff for goat nutrition, due to the valuable and complementary nutritional characteristics of their foliage. Implications: The use of the studied species as fodder resource may be particularly relevant during drought periods and in the late summer when herbage quality decreases, especially in terms of crude protein and fatty acid profile.;10.1071/AN18771;https://doi.org/10.1071/AN18771;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
V9URBYCQ;2022;"Ravhuhali, Khuliso Emmanuel; Msiza, Ntokozo Happy; Mudau, Humbelani Silas";Seasonal dynamics on nutritive value, chemical estimates and in vitro dry matter degradability of some woody species found in rangelands of South Africa;Abstract Unlocking browse species in semi-arid regions can be a key to improving the livestock productivity. The research was conducted to assess the browse species variation in chemical composition and in vitro dry matter degradability as influenced by seasonal (summer and winter) changes. Leaves from ten randomly selected browsable trees from sixteen species ( Vachellia karroo , Senegalia nigrescens , Vachellia nilotica , Balanites maughamii , Berchemia discolor, Berchemia zeyheri , Bridelia mollis , Combretum collinum , Combretum imberbe , Dalbergia melanoxylon , Dichrostachys cinerea , Grewia monticola , Grewia occidentalis , Melia azedarach , Ormocarpum kirkii and Ziziphus mucronata ) were harvested before defoliation from the site in two seasons (summer and winter) and dried at room temperature and then ground for analysis. Two-way analysis was used to analyse chemical composition and in vitro ruminal dry matter degradability. Melia azedarach (343.7 g/kg DM) had the highest ( p < 0.0001) CP content in summer. In winter, B. maughamii (210.3 g/kg DM) had the highest ( p < 0.05) crude protein content. Combretum collinum (2.90 Mcal/kg) had a highest ( p < 0.0001) metabolizable energy value in summer. Bridelia mollis, B. maughamii, B. discolor, C. collinum, C. imberbe, O. kirkii, S. nigrescens, V. nilotica, G. occidentalis and B. zeyheri had the same ( p > 0.0001) dry matter degradability (DMD) 48 values across two seasons. In both seasons, most of these browse species have the potential to supplement low quality natural grasses because they go beyond the minimum requirement of protein and have coherent amounts of fibre concentration. There is a need to assess the bioactive compounds found in these browse species for the amelioration and also to maximize browsing of these species.;10.1007/s10457-021-00683-x;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-021-00683-x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PYFAZY37;2019;Rijal, Swodesh;Agroforestry System: Approaches for Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation;Climate change is the burning issue of today's world. Climate change itself as a natural process but in recent years it will lead to changes in rainfall pattern, variation in temperature, sea level rises, increasing severity and various extreme weather events. Small landholder farmers (Subsistence) are unable to cope with such climatic hazards but there is a tremendous scope of expanding agro- forestry. Climate change is well buffered and resilience builds up by Agroforestry. It is the sustainable land use system where integra- tion of woody perennials, crops and livestock on the same unit of land. Improved farm productivity, environmental sustainability, food security, income diversification, specific coping strategies, better standard of living, soil and water conservation etc are major benefit of agroforestry. Sustainability attributes of agroforestry and carbon sequestration by trees shown potential towards climate change mitigation(GHG reduction) and adaptation. Various Agroforestry systems have own mitigation and adaptation potential towards climate variability. Among various categories and components, Tree like Dalbergia sisoo, Acacia nilotica, Magnifera indica, Gmelina etc plays a crucial role in agroforestry. Tree on farm perform production (Wood, timber, gums, essential oil), protection (Physical, biological), regulation (hydrological cycle, global warming, carbon sequestration) functions. So, Agroforestry considered as a weapon in climate change fight. Agroforestry could be a viable option of livelihood development as well. Therefore, an attempt was made to review on Agroforestry, benefits, its role in carbon sequestration and potential towards climate change mitigation and adaptation;10.31080/asag.2019.03.0621;https://doi.org/10.31080/asag.2019.03.0621;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Glioblastoma is the most advanced stage with the worst prognosis. Current therapies are still unable to provide an effective cure. Recent advances in oncolytic immunotherapy have generated great expectations in the cancer therapy field. The use of oncolytic viruses (OVs) in cancer treatment is one such immune-related therapeutic alternative. OVs have a double oncolytic action by both directly destroying the cancer cells and stimulating a tumor specific immune response to return the ability of tumors to escape the control of the immune system. OVs are one promising alternative to conventional therapies in glioma tumor treatment. Several clinical trials have proven the feasibility of using some viruses to specifically infect tumors, eluding undesired toxic effects in the patient. Here, we revisited the literature to describe the main OVs proposed up to the present moment as therapeutic alternatives in order to destroy glioma cells in vitro and trigger tumor destruction in vivo. Oncolytic viruses were divided with respect to the genome in DNA and RNA viruses. Here, we highlight the results obtained in various clinical trials, which are exploring the use of these agents as an alternative where other approaches provide limited hope.;10.3390/ijms21207604;https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21207604;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A; Zizka, Alexander; van der Plas, Fons";Effects of large herbivores on fire regimes and wildfire mitigation;Abandonment of agricultural land is widespread in many parts of the world, leading to shrub and tree encroachment. The increase of flammable plant biomass, that is, fuel load, increases the risk and intensity of wildfires. Fuel reduction by herbivores is a promising management strategy to avoid fuel build-up and mitigate wildfires. However, their effectiveness in mitigating wildfire damage may depend on a range of factors, including herbivore type, population density and feeding patterns. Here, we review the evidence on whether management with herbivores can reduce fuel load and mitigate wildfires, and if so, how to identify suitable management that can achieve fire mitigation objectives while providing other ecosystem services. We systematically reviewed studies that investigated links between herbivores, fire hazard, fire frequency and fire damage. We found that, in general, herbivores reduce fuel load most effectively when they are mixed feeders, when grazing and browsing herbivores are combined and when herbivore food preferences match the local vegetation. In some cases, the combination of herbivory with other management strategies, such as mechanical clearing, is necessary to reduce wildfire damage. Synthesis and Applications. We conclude that herbivores have the capacity to mitigate wildfire damage, and we provide guidance for grazing management for wildfire mitigation strategies. As areas undergoing land abandonment are particularly prone to wildfires, the maintenance or promotion of grazing by domestic or wild herbivores is a promising tool to reduce wildfire risk in a cost-effective way, while also providing other ecosystem services. Relevant land-use policies, including fire suppression policies, agricultural and forest(ry) policies could incentivise the use of herbivores for better wildfire prevention.;10.1111/1365-2664.13972;https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13972;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The effects of agroforestry and grass-legume buffers on in situ water infiltration relative to row crop management (RC) were assessed for a claypan soil in northeastern Missouri, USA. Infiltration rates were observed in early June in 2014 and 2015 for water- sheds under corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) management; these watersheds had agro- forestry buffers (AGB) or grass buffers (GB). The dominant soil for the watersheds was Putnam silt loam (fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Albaqualf). The water- sheds were in no-till management and established in 1991 with agroforestry buffers and GBs implemented in 1997. Agroforestry buffers, 4.5 m wide and 36.5 m apart, consisted of redtop (Agrostis gigantean Roth), brome (Bromus spp.), and birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) with pin oak (Quercus palustris Menchh.), swamp white oak (Q. bicolor Willd.), and bur oak (Q. macrocarpa Michx.) trees. GBs consisted of redtop, brome, and birdsfoot trefoil. Significant differences were found among the treatments in 2014 for the sorptivity parameter for the fitted infiltration equations with the highest values for agroforestry buffers. Significantly higher saturated hydraulic con- ductivity values were found for the buffer treatments in 2015. Soil water content measurements were assessed over time for years 2010 and 2011 with sensors at 5, 10, 20 and 40 cm depths for the agroforestry buffer and RC areas. Water content decreased more rapidly during the summer season within agroforestry buffers relative to RC areas; however, water infiltration was higher within agro- forestry buffers during the recharge period.";10.1007/s10457-016-9899-x;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-016-9899-x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZQX746T7;2010;"Sánchez, Iván A; Lassaletta, Luis; McCollin, Duncan; Bunce, Robert G H";The effect of hedgerow loss on microclimate in the Mediterranean region: an investigation in Central Spain;In Central Spain hedgerows are an impor- tant component of the landscape although many have been lost due to landscape planning and reallotment programmes. Loss of hedgerows can produce changes in environmental conditions that can be especially critical in summer, corresponding with the dry period in Mediterranean ecosystems. In order to show the effects of hedgerow removal on summer Mediterra- nean environmental conditions in rural landscapes, this paper describes a comparison of some key environmental conditions between areas where hedge- rows are still present, compared to areas where they have been removed. Through a two-way ANOVA, it was found that temperatures in the hedgerows were significantly different from those in the fields, whilst air temperatures beneath the hedgerows were lower, and steadier, than those of surrounding areas. When temperatures of the fields were compared to those sites where hedgerows had been removed, significant differences in temperatures were detected below- ground and sometimes at soil surface level but not at higher levels. The levels of soil water content and organic carbon were higher where hedgerows were still in place. These differences indicate potentially negative environmental impacts due to hedgerow removal. The implications of hedgerow conservation for environmental protection and for cropland pro- ductivity are discussed;10.1007/s10457-009-9224-z;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-009-9224-z;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Thus, the objective of this study was to assess if alley cropping with annual crops can contribute to i) mitigate soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, ii) enhance C sequestration in a semiarid Mediterranean irrigated citrus orchard, and iii) increase land productivity. For this, two different treatments were established: i) conventional mandarin monoculture (MC) with no alley cropping; and ii) mandarin diversified with alley cropping of barley/vetch and fava bean (DIV). Measurements of soil CO2 and N2O emissions were periodically performed (every 7–20 days) during two years. Soil CO2 emission rates followed the soil moisture trend, and showed no significant differences between treatments. As an average, soil CO2 emission rates were 147 mg m-2 h-1 in MC and 196 mg m-2 h-1 in DIV. Soil N2O emission rates were not correlated to soil moisture nor temperature, and showed average values of 0.026 mg m-2 h-1 in MC and − 0.002 mg m-2 h-1 in DIV. Alley cropping did not contribute to significantly increase soil organic C and total nitrogen in two years’ time. With regard to production, mandarin yield showed no significant differences between treatments, but alley crops contributed to complementary commodities to the main cash crop, increasing overall land productivity. Thus, alley cropping in irrigated Mediterranean orchards has no significant effect on soil C sequestration and GHG emissions at short-term, with increased land productivity owing to new commodities grown in the alleys. These results confirm that under semiarid Mediterranean climate, long periods are needed to efficiently assess soil C sequestration potential of sustainable practices in orchards.";10.1016/j.eja.2022.126684;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2022.126684;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MMUTFNKE;2014;"Schütz, K E; Cox, N R; Tucker, C B";A field study of the behavioral and physiological effects of varying amounts of shade for lactating cows at pasture;Shade reduces the negative effects of heat load, but little is known about how much is required for efficient cooling in commercial settings. The effect of the amount of shade on 8 Holstein-Friesian herds was studied for 2 consecutive summers (mean temperature: 23°C) on 6 commercial, pasture-based dairy farms. Farms varied in the amount of natural shade provided (range: 0 to 15.6 m2 shade/cow). Time spent in shade, near water, eating, ruminating, lying, and standing were recorded between 1000 and 1530 h in 31 shaded and 11 unshaded paddocks using 20-min instantaneous scan observations of 15 focal cows/herd. Respiration rate and panting score (0 to 4.5) was recorded for focal animals once per hour. The total numbers of cows in shade, near water, and with panting scores ≥2 were recorded every 30 min. Cows without shade spent 4% more time lying than cows with shade (standard error of the difference, SED = 1.9%). A larger proportion of the herd had panting scores ≥2 when no shade was available (6 vs. 2% of the herd, SED = 1.2%), and respiration rates were higher by 8 breaths/min in cows without shade (SED = 4.7 breaths/min). Under the conditions tested, the maxi- mum proportion of the herd that was observed using the shade increased by 3.1% for every 1-m2 increase in shade size [standard error (SE) = 1.51%], and all cows were first seen simultaneously using shade when 2 m2/ cow was provided. For every 1-m2 increase in shade, 0.3% fewer cows had panting score ≥2 (SE = 0.12%). We observed no significant relationships between the amount of shade available and any other variables. Although additional work is required to make specific recommendations, these results indicate that providing more shade allowed a higher proportion of animals to use this resource and reduced respiratory signs of heat load.;10.3168/jds.2013-7649;https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2013-7649;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Cows spent more than twice as much time in the larger shade (24 vs. 50% of observations for 2.4 m2 and 9.6 m2 shade/cow, respectively, SED: 1.7%) and engaged in fewer aggressive interactions when more shade was provided (10.7 vs. 3.2 aggressive interactions/m2 during 5.8 h of observation for 2.4 m2 and 9.6 m2 shade/cow, respectively, SED: 3.16 interactions/m2). Time around the water trough increased when little or no shade was provided (11, 5, and 2% of observations within 4.5 m of water trough for no shade, 2.4 m2, and 9.6 m2 shade/ cow, SED: 2.4%). Respiration rate was higher when cows had less shade available (62, 57, and 51 breaths/ min for no shade, 2.4 m2, and 9.6 m2 shade/cow, respec- tively, SED: 2.1 breaths/min). All cows used the shade more when 9.6 m2 shade/cow was provided; simultane- ous use was observed in 15 versus 0% of observations in the 9.6 m2 and 2.4 m2 treatments on the warmest day, respectively. Weather conditions influenced both the behavioral and physiological responses, and these changes were more pronounced when less or no shade was available. Cows spent more time in shade and less time lying with increasing heat load. In addition, ag- gressive interactions in the shade, time around the water trough, mean body temperature, and respiration rate increased with environmental heat load. Our findings highlight the importance of determining and providing an effective amount of shade to cattle";10.3168/jds.2009-2416;https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2009-2416;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZGTC4B9Y;2004;"Sharrow, S H; Ismail, S";Carbon and nitrogen storage in agroforests, tree plantations, and pastures in western Oregon, USA;Pastures store over 90% of their carbon and nitrogen below-ground as soil organic matter. In contrast, temperate conifer forests often store large amounts of organic matter above-ground in woody plant tissue and fibrous litter. Silvopastures, which combine managed pastures with forest trees, should accrete more carbon and nitrogen than pastures or timber plantations because they may produce more total annual biomass and have both forest and grassland nutrient cycling patterns active. This hypothesis was investigated by conducting carbon and nitrogen inventories on three replications of 11 year-old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)/perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne)/subclover (Trifolium subterraneum) agroforests, ryegrasss/subclover pastures, and Douglas-fir timber plantations near Corvallis, Oregon in August 2000. Over the 11 years since planting, agroforests accumulated approximately 740 kg ha(-1) year(-1) more C than forests and 520 kg ha(-1) year(-1) more C than pastures. Agroforests stored approximately 12% of C and 2% of N aboveground compared to 9% of C and 1% of N above ground in plantations and less than 1% of N and C aboveground in pastures. Total N content of agroforests and pastures, both of which included a nitrogen-fixing legume, were approximately 530 and 1200 kg ha(-1) greater than plantations, respectively. These results support the proposition that agroforests, such as silvopastures, may be more efficient at accreting C than plantations or pasture monocultures. However, pastures may accrete more N than agroforests or plantations. This apparent separation of response in obviously interrelated agroecosystem processes, points out the difficulty in using forest plantation or pasture research results to predict outcomes for mixed systems such as agroforests.;10.1023/B:AGFO.0000013267.87896.41;https://doi.org/10.1023/B:AGFO.0000013267.87896.41;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The experiment was carried out during the warm season, spanning spring, summer, and fall seasons in the Brazilian subtropical climate zone. Twelve lactating Jersey cows were observed in rotational grazing on Cynodon nlemfuensis Vanderyst and Panicum maximum Jacq. Treatments were composed of different grazing systems (silvopasture and conventional pasture). The silvopasture grazing system had eucalyptus trees (Eucalyptus grandis Hill ex Maiden) with an average height of≈ 10 m and row spacing of 20 m. In the conventional pasture grazing system, there were no rows of eucalyptus and no other type of tree or structure to provide shade to the animals. During the summer and fall periods ofevaluation, the silvopasture animals presented a lower respiratory rate, whereas during the spring and fall evaluation periods, these animals presented a lower rectal temperature. Cattle in the silvopasture showed longer grazing times at night (+21.65 min) and overall (+36.00 min) and remained lying down (ruminating and resting) for longer (+ 73.07 min) than conventional pasture grazing system animals. In addition, the animals in the silvopasture had a lower water intake (3.12 L/100 kg BW). The silvopasture grazing system improved the welfare ofthe grazing Jersey cows, as evidenced by the improvement in physiological response to heat stress, increased grazing time and decreased standing time (resting + ruminanting) when compared to cows in the conventional pasture grazing system.;10.1007/s11250-021-02648-9;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11250-021-02648-9;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Data were collected from Dairy Herd Improvement As- sociation records of 142 Jersey and 586 Holstein cows from the Bearden Dairy Research Center at Mississippi State University (Mississippi State). Heat stress cli- matic conditions were determined using a temperature- humidity index (THI) to combine dry bulb temperature and relative humidity into one measure. Two analyses were conducted to determine the effects of HS. Heat stress was defined as THI ≥72, and reported as HS+ for the first analysis and HS for the second analysis. The first analysis compared breeds during HS+ and non-heat-stress (HS−) conditions. Holstein milk yield decreased during HS+, whereas Jersey milk yield in- creased. Milk fat percentage for Holstein and Jersey cows declined during HS+. Holstein fat-corrected milk yield decreased during HS+, whereas Jersey fat-cor- rected milk yield during HS+ did not differ from that during HS−. During HS+, somatic cell score increased in milk from Holstein and Jersey cows compared with HS−. In the second analysis, HS was categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. The corresponding THI val- ues were THI ≥72 but <79, THI ≥79 but <90, and THI ≥90. Holstein milk yield declined during moderate and severe HS, whereas Jersey milk yield declined dur- ing severe HS. Holstein milk fat percentage was less during moderate and severe HS compared with milk fat percentage during mild HS. Jersey milk fat percentage did not differ with regard to HS category. Jersey cows appeared to be more heat tolerant than Holstein cows; however, Holstein cows still produced larger volumes of milk.";10.3168/jds.2012-5737;https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-5737;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
XJU5V9Y8;2023;"Thiesmeier, Alma; Zander, Peter";Can agroforestry compete? A scoping review of the economic performance of agroforestry practices in Europe and North America;This scoping review looks at the literature published on the economic performance of temperate agroforestry systems in Europe and North America and tries to answers the following research questions: How does agro- forestry (AF) perform economically compared to agriculture and/or forestry? And are there any particular system characteristics or conditions that make them more competitive? Results show that generally, AF is not able to compete with agricultural land use but there are notable exceptions. Especially improved policy conditions and internalising environmental externalities can make AF competitive. Compared to forestry AF is generally able to achieve better economic outcomes. The economic performance is, in addition to ecosystem service payments and policy support, dependent on soil and site characteristic, as well as prices and the profitability of the individual system components. Intensive management and increased knowledge of these systems also increase competi- tiveness. There are various research gaps such as economic risk on farm- and plot-level, economic performance of AF under future climate change, or a comparison of different sustainability enhancing measures in agriculture.;10.1016/j.forpol.2023.102939;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2023.102939;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Preventive clearings are frequently applied in a mix of systematic and selective ways, being a potential biomass source using technologies such as the collector-bundler BioBaler WB55. Our research aimed to compare the BioBaler with a chain mulcher performing systematic mulching of 50% vs. 67% of stand surface over 11.4 ha dominated by Pinus pinaster Ait. regenerated after a severe wildfire. Time studies included the machinery GPS follow-up and the weighing of each produced bale. Environmental aspects were also assessed. A regression curve related BioBaler weight productivity (odt Workh-1) to pine biovolume (cover (%) average tree height, m). Surface productivity (stand ha Workh-1) was greater for both technologies when a lower percentage of the total surface was cleared, but less than theoretically predicted. The BioBaler’s economic balance, including the cost of further selective clearing and the income from biomass selling, was costlier than that of the mulcher-in the most representative strata, 475 EUR ha-1 vs. 350 EUR ha-1. Under the studied conditions, BioBaler was not economically competitive with the conventional treatment, its main constraint being low collection efficiency (31% of the standing biomass in the cleared surface, 5.33 out of 17.1 fresh tonnes ha-1).;10.3390/f12080979;https://doi.org/10.3390/f12080979;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Wildfire problems have been worsened by complex interactions between land use, livestock grazing and human population during the 20th century. In this study we try to understand these interactions and relationships. Area of study: Portugal country. Material and methods: For the mainland Portuguese territory we present a statistical temporal analysis (1930-2001) based on the densities of livestock grazing and human inhabitants at the smallest administrative unit level, the parish. We compare these data with fire incidence descriptors (average area burned and average fire density) between 1990 and 2007. Research highlights: We have identified clusters of parishes sharing common trends in the evolution of livestock and human inhabitant densities. A cause-effect relationship was not detected between livestock grazing density and fire incidence. However, the results point out clusters of parishes where conflicts between forest, fire and livestock grazing are important in the North, Centre and South regions of Portugal.;10.5424/fs/2014231-02758;https://doi.org/10.5424/fs/2014231-02758;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
M8ADTWJZ;2013;"Upson, M A; Burgess, P J";Soil organic carbon and root distribution in a temperate arable agroforestry system;Aim: To determine, for arable land in a temperate area, the effect of tree establishment and intercropping treatments, on the distribution of roots and soil organic carbon to a depth of 1.5 m. Methods: A poplar (Populus sp.) silvoarable agroforestry experiment including arable controls was established on arable land in lowland England in 1992. The trees were intercropped with an arable rotation or bare fallow for the first 11 years, thereafter grass was allowed to establish. Coarse and fine root distributions (to depths of up to 1.5 m and up to 5 m from the trees) were measured in 1996, 2003, and 2011. The amount and type of soil carbon to 1.5 m depth was also measured in 2011. Results: The trees, initially surrounded by arable crops rather than fallow, had a deeper coarse root distribution with less lateral expansion. In 2011, the combined length of tree and understorey vegetation roots was greater in the agroforestry treatments than the control, at depths below 0.9 m. Between 0 and 1.5 m depth, the fine root carbon in the agroforestry treatment (2.56 t C ha-1) was 79% greater than that in the control (1.43 t C ha-1). Although the soil organic carbon in the top 0.6 m under the trees (161 t C ha-1) was greater than in the control (142 t C ha-1), a tendency for smaller soil carbon levels beneath the trees at lower depths, meant that there was no overall tree effect when a 1.5 m soil depth was considered. From a limited sample, there was no tree effect on the proportion of recalcitrant soil organic carbon. Conclusions: The observed decline in soil carbon beneath the trees at soil depths greater than 60 cm, if observed elsewhere, has important implication for assessments of the role of afforestation and agroforestry in sequestering carbon.;10.1007/s11104-013-1733-x;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11104-013-1733-x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

H; Vandaele, L.";Effect of summer conditions and shade on the production and metabolism of Holstein dairy cows on pasture in temperate climate;For dairy cattle on pasture in temperate regions, it is largely unknown to what degree hot summer conditions impact energy metabolism, milk yield and milk composition and how effective shade is in reducing these negative effects. During the summer of 2012, a herd of Holstein cows was kept on pasture without access to shade (treatment NS). During the summers of 2011 and 2013, the herd was divided into a group with (treatment S) and a group without (treatment NS) access to shade. Shade was provided by young trees combined with shade cloths (80% reduction in solar radiation). A weather station registered the local climatic conditions on open pasture, from which we calculated daily average Heat Load Index (HLI) values. The effects of HLI and shade on rectal temperature (RT), blood plasma indicators of hyperventilation and metabolic changes due to heat stress, milk yield and milk composition were investigated. RT increased with increasing HLI, but was less for S cows than for NS cows (by 0.02°C and 0.03°C increase per unit increase of HLI, respectively). Hyperchloraemia (an increased blood plasma concentration of Cl-), a sign of hyperventilation, increased for NS cows but not for S cows. The plasma concentration of alkaline phosphatase, a regulator of energy metabolism in the liver, decreased with increasing HLI for NS cows only. Access to shade, thus, reduced the effect of HLI on RT, hyperchloraemia and the regulation of metabolism by the liver. As HLI increased, the plasma concentration of cholesterol decreased (indicating increased lipolysis) and the plasma concentration of creatinine increased (indicating increased protein catabolism). These effects did not differ between S and NS cows. For NS cows, after a lag-time of 2 days, the milk yield decreased with increasing HLI. For S cows, the milk yield was unaffected by HLI and its quadratic factor. The milk concentrations of lactose, protein and fat decreased as HLI increased, but only the effect on milk protein content was remediated by shade. In conclusion, access to shade tempered the negative effects of high HLI on RT, hyperchloraemia and a blood plasma indicator of changing energy metabolism (generally) as well as prevented the decrease in milk yield observed in cows without access to shade.;10.1017/s1751731115000816;https://doi.org/10.1017/s1751731115000816;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

V; Siebicke, Lukas; Baumeister, Moritz; Moyano, Fernando E.; Knohl, Alexander; Markwitz, Christian";Reducing Wind Erosion through Agroforestry: A Case Study Using Large Eddy Simulations;Wind erosion is seen as one of the main risks for modern agriculture in dry and sandy regions. Shelterbelts and agroforestry systems are known for their ability to reduce wind speed and, consequently, wind erosion. The current study considers temperate alley cropping agroforestry systems, where multiple tree strips (shelterbelts) are interleaved with either annual rotating crops or perennial grassland. The aim was to quantify the potential wind erosion reduction by alley cropping agroforestry systems and the effect of design decisions for a case study in Germany. By combining wind measurements and Large Eddy Simulations, the wind speed and potential wind erosion inside an agroforestry system were estimated. Our model simulations result in an average reduction in wind speed between 17% and 67%, and a reduction of average potential wind erosion between 24% and 97%. The most optimal reduction of the average potential wind erosion was larger than 92% for tree strips orientated perpendicular to the main wind direction, whereas for a diagonal orientation of the tree strips to the main wind direction we found an average reduction of 86%. Parallel orientated tree strips reduce wind erosion on average by less than 35%. Tree strips planted with ≤48 m distance provide a strong and constant reduction of wind erosion, even for tree strips of 2 m height the average reduction was 86%, when the tree strips were orientated optimal to the dominant wind direction. Our model simulations showed that alley cropping agroforestry systems in a temperate climate have a large potential to reduce wind erosion by more than 80% when the system is well-designed and managed.;10.3390/su142013372;https://doi.org/10.3390/su142013372;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LSFZPZER;2021;"Vandana, G D; Sejian, V; Lees, A M; Pragna, P; Silpa, M V; Maloney, Shane K";Heat stress and poultry production: impact and amelioration;Globally, the poultry industry is gaining significant importance among the agricultural and its allied sectors. However, heat stress was found to negatively affect the poultry production particularly in the tropical regions. This review is therefore an attempt to generate information pertaining to the impacts ofheat stress on poultry production and its amelioration. Heat stress reduces the growth, reproductive performance, and egg production in poultry birds. The reduction in productive potential ofpoultry birds on exposure to heat stress may be attributed to the deviation ofenergy resources from production to adaptation pathway. There are different approaches pertaining to relieving the adverse impacts of heat stress on poultry production. These approaches can be broadly categorized under genetic, management, and nutritional strategies. These approaches may reduce the negative effects of heat stress and enhance the productive performance of poultry birds. The management strategies include appropriate shelter design, providing shade, using sprinklers, implementing cooling devices, and using fans and ventilation systems. The recom- mended floor space for mature birds weighing 1.7 kg is 0.06 m2/bird while it is 0.13 m2/bird for the birds weighing 3.5 kg with 27.8 kg/m2 bird density in either case. The nutritional interventions comprise ration balancing and providing essential micronutrients to improve the productive and reproductive performance in poultry birds. Fat, antioxidants, yeast, and electrolyte supplementations are some of the most commonly used nutritional strategies to ensure optimum production in the poultry industry. Furthermore, providing adequate water supply and disease surveillance measures may help to ensure optimum meat and egg production in the birds. The advanced biotechnological tools may aid to identify suitable genetic markers in poultry birds which might help in developing new strains of higher thermo-tolerance by designing suitable breeding program involving marker-assisted selection. These strategies may help to optimize and sustain poultry production in the changing climate scenario.;10.1007/s00484-020-02023-7;https://doi.org/10.1007/s00484-020-02023-7;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Tropical agriculture, particularly subsistence agriculture is particularly vulnerable, as smallholder farmers do not have adequate resources to adapt to climate change. While agroforestry may play a significant role in mitigating the atmospheric accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHG), it also has a role to play in helping smallholder farmers adapt to climate change. In this paper, we examine data on the mitigation potential of agroforestry in the humid and sub-humid tropics. We then present the scientific evidence that leads to the expectation that agroforestry also has an important role in climate change adaptation, particularly for small holder farmers. We conclude with priority research questions that need to be answered concerning the role of agroforestry in both mitigation and adaptation to climate change.;10.1007/s11027-007-9105-6;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11027-007-9105-6;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RNWIYWQQ;2020;"Videbæk, Pernille N; Grunert, Klaus G";Disgusting or delicious? Examining attitudinal ambivalence towards entomophagy among Danish consumers;Current meat consumption habits will need to change, especially those of Western consumers. The level of meat consumption is unsustainable, and a recent study estimates a necessary reduction of 90% of the current intake. Insects are a promising alternative to existing protein sources, but previous literature has emphasised the initial level of disgust displayed towards insects as a food option. The overall aim of this paper is to understand the attitude of consumers towards eating insects, also termed entomophagy, in order to outline the barriers that prevent adoption and provide insights in order to overcome these. Data were collected through an online questionnaire with a representative sample of Danish consumers (n = 975). Several constructs from the lit- erature were measured: food neophobia, disgust, intention to try and intention to eat regularly. In addition, a new attitude scale was used, that specifically measures the attitude towards entomophagy. A discrete choice experiment was a part of the questionnaire. Using LatentGold 5.1 a segmentation analysis based on the choice experiment was conducted. The influences of intention were analysed using hierarchical regression in SPSS 25. Results of the choice experiment indicate that different segments of consumers of entomophagy exist, and that different segments are interested in different types of insects. Younger consumers and males are more positive towards entomophagy in general and the insect options in the choice experiment. Results of the regression analysis indicate that the attitude toward eating insects is multidimensional and that there seem to be indications of attitude ambivalence in all segments. The interest in entomophagy is important, as it will be a key factor in overcoming the barrier of disgust and turning insects into an acceptable food choice in the Western world;10.1016/j.foodqual.2020.103913;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2020.103913;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The experiment was conducted on a dairy farm in Southwest Paraná, Brazil, during the summer of 2014. Crossbred Holstein × Jersey dairy heifers (n = 10) were used in a split-plot design. The fixed effects in this study include time of day (9:00-10:00, 13:00-14:00, and 17:00-18:00 h) under silvopastoral or open pastures conditions, which were the main-plot and split-plot factors, respectively. To assess the environmental conditions in both systems, air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed were recorded. In addition, the temperature-humidity index was calculated based on the microcli-mate measurements. Respiratory rate and hair coat surface temperature of heifers were measured in both groups during time of day (30 days). Diurnal behaviour using focal observations with 0/1 sampling was observed. Data were analysed using Bayesian inference with a mixed effects model. The air temperature was higher (P<0.05) in open pasture conditions than the silvopasture system. Temperature-humidity index values for the silvopasture system were lower than open pasture during the hottest hours of the day. Regarding thermoregulation responses, there was an interaction between time of day and pasture environment (P<0.05). Heifers showed lower respiratory rates and hair coat surface temperature values (P<0.05) when access to shade was provided, mainly during the hottest periods in the afternoon. In addition, there was also an interaction between rumination and water intake (P<0.05), which indicates a higher rumination frequency for animals in the silvopasture system during the hottest period, as well as a higher water intake frequency for heifers in open pasture during midday. These findings imply that the arrangement of trees in a silvopasture system provides better thermal comfort conditions for dairy heifers raised in a subtropical climate.;10.2478/aoas-2019-0074;https://doi.org/10.2478/aoas-2019-0074;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Mortality data (46,610 cases) re- ferred to dairy cows older than 24 mo that died on a farm from all causes from May 1 to September 30 during a 6-yr period (2002–2007). Weather data were obtained from 12 weather stations located in different areas of Italy. Heat waves were defined for each weather station as a period of at least 3 consecutive days, from May 1 to September 30 (2002–2007), when the daily maximum temperature exceeded the 90th percentile of the reference distribution (1971–2000). Summer days were classified as days in heat wave (HW) or not in heat wave (nHW). Days in HW were numbered to evaluate the relationship between mortality and length of the wave. Finally, the first 3 nHW days after the end of a heat wave were also considered to account for potential prolonged effects. The mortality risk was evaluated using a case-crossover design. A conditional logistic regression model was used to calculate odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for mortality recorded in HW compared with that recorded in nHW days pooled and stratified by duration of exposure, age of cows, and month of occurrence. Dairy cows mortality was greater during HW compared with nHW days. Furthermore, compared with nHW days, the risk of mortality contin- ued to be higher during the 3 d after the end of HW. Mortality increased with the length of the HW. Consid- ering deaths stratified by age, cows up to 28 mo were not affected by HW, whereas all the other age catego- ries of older cows (29–60, 61–96, and >96 mo) showed a greater mortality when exposed to HW. The risk of death during HW was higher in early summer months. In particular, the highest risk of mortality was observed during June HW. Present results strongly support the implementation of adaptation strategies which may limit heat stress-related impairment of animal welfare and economic losses in dairy cow farm during HW;10.3168/jds.2015-9331;https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-9331;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

W.; Cornelis, W.; Strauss, P.; Michel, K.";Ecosystem services of tree windbreaks in rural landscapes - A systematic review;Windbreaks are key structural elements in the rural environment and affect the functionality of landscapes in multiple ways. A broad interdisciplinary view on these functions lacks in scientific literature and common knowledge. This led to under informed management decisions, a decrease in the number of windbreaks in wide areas, and a subsequent loss of landscape functionality. Therefore, the knowledge on windbreaks and associated ecosystem services (ES) was systematically reviewed to guide the way for a holistic comprehension of such structural landscape elements. We defined eight bundles of ES on the basis of the Common International Classification of ES scheme. Search terms that allowed to include only vegetative windbreaks consisting of at least one tree row were combined with appropriate search terms for the eight ES bundles in individual searches resulting in a total of 6094 hits. We considered only publications that provided quantitative data and allowed to derive a clear effect of windbreaks on ES so that 222 publications from all over the world were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. The outcomes provide information about the dimension of effort, scientific consensus or dissensus, and knowledge gaps in the different research disciplines involved. It was shown that windbreaks bring predominantly positive effects to landscapes in the course of all investigated ES bundles. Apparent positive effects were found for soil protection, biodiversity and pest control, whereas for biomass production, nutrient and water balance, also adverse or indifferent effects were reported. The present review reveals an intense need for further interdisciplinary research using indicators, ES approaches or similar instruments that enable quantitative and comparable statements about the functionality of windbreaks in rural landscapes.;10.1088/1748-9326/ac1d0d;https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac1d0d;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

88GC9I2E;2022;"Wolpert, Franziska; Quintas-Soriano, Cristina; Pulido, Fernando; Huntsinger, Lynn; Plieninger, Tobias";Collaborative agroforestry to mitigate wildfires in Extremadura, Spain: land manager motivations and perceptions of outcomes, benefits, and policy needs;Wildfires are increasing in severity, and magnitude in the Mediterranean Basin in recent years, reaching a yearly average of 450 000 ha over the last decade. Drivers include climate change, land- use change, and land abandonment. Wildfire mitiga- tion requires landscape-level action as impact to each parcel is affected by the conditions of the others. We conducted a case study of a regional-level initiative that develops community efforts to mitigate wildfires through silvo-pastoral agroforestry systems, using an integrated landscape management approach. This approach involves collaboration among stakehold- ers to achieve multiple objectives. In order to derive insights into its potential, we asked participating land managers: (1) What motivates their participa- tion?, (2) How do they perceive initiative outcomes?, and as urban outmigrants with non-traditional goals are increasing in rural areas, (3) Do responses dif- fer between rural and neo-rural participants? Our results show that managers feel highly affected by wildfires and are strongly motivated to reduce wild- fire risk. Land abandonment and inappropriate policy were major concerns. The initiative was seen to have positive outcomes for individual participants as well as the region, and to stimulate community connect- edness. We conclude that fit to local contexts, inte- grated landscape management can be a well-received approach to reducing wildfire risk. Agroforestry systems in Extremadura can act as “productive fuel- breaks” that reduce fire risk over extensive areas, while restoring traditional landscapes. We suggest that programs to reduce wildfire risk can also be used as a leverage point for financing rural revival and pro- vision of multiple ecosystem services.;10.1007/s10457-022-00771-6;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-022-00771-6;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Champion, Wyatt";Chemical composition, structures, and light absorption of N-containing aromatic compounds emitted from burning wood and charcoal in household cookstoves;"N-containing aromatic compounds (NACs) are an important group of light-absorbing molecules in the atmosphere. They are often observed in combustion emissions, but their chemical formulas and structural characteristics remain uncertain. In this study, red oakwood and charcoal fuels were burned in cookstoves using the standard water-boiling test (WBT) procedure. Submicron aerosol particles in the cookstove emissions were collected using quartz (Qf) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter membranes positioned in parallel. A backup quartz filter (Qb) was also installed downstream of the PTFE filter to evaluate the effect of sampling artifacts on NAC measurements. Liquid chromatography- mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) techniques identified 17 NAC chemical formulas in the cookstove emissions. The average concentrations of total NACs in Qb samples (0:370:31- 1:790:77 ugm3) were greater than 50%of those observed in the Qf samples (0:510:43-3:912:06 ugm3), and the Qb-to-Qf mass ratios of individual NACs had a range of 0.02-2.71, indicating that the identified NACs might have substantial fractions remaining in the gas phase. In comparison to other sources, cookstove emissions from red oak or charcoal fuels did not exhibit unique NAC structural features but had distinct NAC composition. However, before identifying NAC sources by combining their structural and compositional information, the gas-particle partitioning behaviors of NACs should be further investigated. The average contributions of total NACs to the light absorption of organic matter at D 365 nm (1.10 %-2.57 %) in Qf and Qb samples (10.7 %-21.0 %) are up to 10 times larger than their mass contributions (Qf: 0.31 %-1.01 %; Qb: 1.08 %- 3.31 %), so the identified NACs are mostly strong light absorbers. To explain more sample extract absorption, future research is needed to understand the chemical and optical properties of high-molecular-weight (e.g., molecular weight, MW> 500 Da) entities in particulate matter.";10.5194/acp-20-14077-2020;https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-14077-2020;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Shade is one of the most important functions provided by urban trees for mitigating UHI. However, the cooling effect of tree shade has not been adequately investigated. In this study, we used a simple and straightforward method to quantify the spatial and temporal variation of tree shade and examined its effect on land surface temperature (LST). We used the hillshade function in a geographic information system to quantify the spatiotemporal patterns of tree shade by integrating sun location and tree height. Relationships between shade and LST were then compared in two cities, Tampa, Florida and New York City (NYC), New York. We found that: (1) Hillshade function combining the sun location and tree height can accurately capture the spatial and temporal variation of tree shade; (2) Tree shade, particularly at 07:30, has significant cooling effect on LST in Tampa and NYC; and (3) Shade has a stronger cooling effect in Tampa than in NYC, which is most likely due to the differences in the ratio of tree canopy to impervious surface cover, the spatial arrangements of trees and buildings, and their relative heights. Comparing the cooling effects of tree shade in two cities, this study provides important insights for urban planners for UHI mitigation in different cities.";10.1016/j.jag.2020.102161;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2020.102161;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Here, we find that trees in pasturelands (“silvopasture”) across Latin America and Africa can offer substantial cooling benefits. These cooling benefits increase linearly by −0.32 °C to −2.4 °C per 10 metric tons of woody carbon per hectare, and importantly do not depend on the spatial extent of the silvopasture systems. Thus, even smallholders can reap important cooling services from intensifying their silvopasture practices. We then map where realistic (but ambitious) silvopasture expansion could counteract a substantial fraction of the local projected warming in 2050 due to climate change. Our findings indicate where and to what extent silvopasture systems can counteract local temperature increases from global climate change and help vulnerable communities adapt to a warming world.;10.1038/s41467-022-28388-4;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28388-4;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
